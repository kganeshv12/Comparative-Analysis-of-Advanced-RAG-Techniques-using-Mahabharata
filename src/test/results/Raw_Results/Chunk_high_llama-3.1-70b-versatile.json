This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context.

A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\\n\\ngreat happiness in that forest. Towards the close of that period, O\\n\\nsinless one, Vyasa came there. While all those princes sat around Vyasa,\\n\\nengaged in conversation on diverse subjects, other Rishis came to that\\n\\nspot. They were Narada, and Parvata and Devala of austere penances, and\\n\\nViswavasu and Tumvuru, and Chitrasena., O Bharata. Endued with severe\\n\\npenances, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, with the permission of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, worshipped them according to due rites. Having obtained\\n\\nthat worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats\\n\\n(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock\\n\\nfeathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\\n\\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths.

Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons.

Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path.

During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are.
