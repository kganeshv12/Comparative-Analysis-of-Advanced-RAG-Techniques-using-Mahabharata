When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\nfor the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts.

Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons.

Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness.

With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery.

Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nexcellent and well-decked horses, and with quivers on their backs, they\\n\\nsurrounded that horse, O king, and endeavoured to capture it. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, reflecting on that endeavour of theirs, forbade\\n\\nthose heroes, with conciliatory speeches, O chastiser of foes.\\n\\nDisregarding Arjuna's message, they assailed him with their shafts. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna resisted those warriors who were under the sway of\\n\\ndarkness and passion. Jishnu, addressed them smilingly and said, 'Desist,\\n\\nye unrighteous ones. Life is a benefit (that should not be thrown away).'\\n\\nAt the time of his setting out, he had been earnestly ordered by king\\n\\nYudhishthira the just, not to slay those Kshatriyas whose kinsmen had\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\\n\\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt.

Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished.

All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind.

Dhrshtadymna was commander in chief of seven commanders. The Pandavas made seven commanders for the seven divisions. The army of Pandavas was decentralized in to seven divisions called as Akshauhini.

Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives.

This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\\n\\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\\n\\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\\n\\njust never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of\\n\\nAmvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great\\n\\nenergy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and\\n\\njuice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as\\n\\nbefore.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse\\n\\nkinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of\\n\\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\\n\\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity.

Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nand every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial.

In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making.

Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nInference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently. Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield.

So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow.

On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success.

Dhrshtadymna was commander in chief of seven commanders. The Pandavas made seven commanders for the seven divisions. The army of Pandavas was decentralized in to seven divisions called as Akshauhini.

Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble.

The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru.

Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna.

The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson.

It also touches on the concept of fulfilling vows and the power of righteous individuals.  There is no mention of cannibalism in the provided context. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 2: \\nAnswer 2: The provided text does not contain the answer to your question.  \\nI need more context to understand what you are asking. \\nPlease provide more information or rephrase your question. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 3: 1. **\\\"Karna and Arjuna character analysis: similarities and differences\\\"** - This query focuses on a direct comparison of the two characters, seeking information about their shared traits and contrasting aspects.\\nAnswer 3: Karna and Arjuna are both exceptionally skilled warriors with strong moral compasses.  While they share virtues like valor and loyalty, Karna's loyalty lies with Duryodhana despite knowing his cause is wrong, while Arjuna fights for the Pandavas and righteousness.  Their contrasting choices ultimately shape their destinies and legacies. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 4: 2. **\\\"Parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna in Mahabharata\\\"** - This query explores the thematic significance of their parallel journeys, prompting results about how their experiences and choices reflect larger epic themes.\\nAnswer 4: The provided text focuses on the individual characters and their roles in the Mahabharata, not on a comparative analysis of Karna and Arjuna's journeys.  Therefore, I cannot answer your question using the given context.  \\n\\n\\nQuestion 5: 3. **\\\"Themes of duty, friendship, and fate in Mahabharata: Karna and Arjuna\\\"** - This query connects the characters to specific themes within the epic, seeking analyses of how their actions and relationships illustrate these concepts. \\nAnswer 5: Karna's loyalty to Duryodhana exemplifies the theme of duty, as he feels obligated to his friend despite knowing the Kauravas' wrongdoings.  His friendship with Duryodhana, though ultimately detrimental, highlights the complexities of loyalty and the power of personal bonds.  Fate plays a role in Karna's life as he is repeatedly denied his rightful place and ultimately sacrifices himself in a battle predetermined by destiny. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 6: \\nAnswer 6: The provided text does not contain the answer to your question.  \\nThe text focuses on the afterlife and the importance of sons and grandsons in Hindu tradition. \\nIt does not discuss the topic of the question. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuestion 7: \\nAnswer 7: The provided text does not contain the answer to your question.

The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nrace, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion of Renunciation, traversed through various countries and reached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind him was Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order of their birth; behind them all, O foremost one of Bharatas race, proceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of dark complexion, and endued with eyes resembling lotus petals. While the Pandavas set out for the forest, a dog followed them.\\n Answer : Draupadi played a significant role in the Mahabharata, participating in decision-making and binding the Pandavas together.  Her disrobing by the Kauravas was a key event that led to the war.  She is portrayed as a strong and influential woman who challenged patriarchal norms. \\n\\n\\n\\n Sub Question : 2. **\\\"Kunti Mahabharata character analysis dharma and power\\\"**: This query explores Kunti's choices through the lens of dharma and power dynamics, key themes in the epic.\\n Retrieved Documents : Inference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently.

Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\npersons in sacrifices and in obsequial rites, after the manner of all the\\n\\ngreat kings of antiquity. The high-minded son of Kunti is mild, and\\n\\nself-restrained, and is always disposed to spend as if he were a second\\n\\nVaisravana. He has great ministers that attend on him. He is\\n\\ncompassionate to even his foes. Indeed, that foremost one of Bharata's\\n\\nrace is of pure conduct.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n Answer : Kunti is portrayed as a powerful figure in the Mahabharata, acting as the final decision-maker for the Pandavas.

During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing the fact that Karna will defeat him. The incident shows the commitment and dedication of Yudhishthra. There is also example of extraordinary commitment shown by Abhimanyu. Though he had partial knowledge of only breaking the \\u2018Chakarvayu\\u2019 even then he went in to the Chakarvayu to fail the mission. Therefore, managers should select the employees who are committed and dedicated. 3.5 Empathetic and effective communication Effective management necessitates empathetic and effective communication skills. A manager should not loose his temper and should try to manage each and every situation peacefully. Affectionate words used with full respect can do the wonders in effective management. Mahabharata\\u2019s incident highlights the importance of effective communication. When Gandhari wished to curse\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind.

Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n Answer : The burning of Khandava Forest had devastating consequences for the wildlife, causing widespread death and displacement.  The forest fires also threatened the lives of King Virata and his family, forcing them to seek refuge.

Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him.

Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata.
