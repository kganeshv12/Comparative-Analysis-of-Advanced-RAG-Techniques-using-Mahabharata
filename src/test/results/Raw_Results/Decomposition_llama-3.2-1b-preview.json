Corporate should concentrate on expanded management and decentralized leadership. They should restructure their teams to share management responsibilities. The sharing of responsibilities through decentralization will generate new ideas, innovative practices. This will help the team members to take responsibilities and grow higher.

At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights.

Krishna, being a wise and just ruler, wanted to guide Arjuna and help him overcome his fatigue and emaciation, and to teach him the importance of proper guidance and mentorship.\\n\\n\\n Sub Question : 3. **What motivated Krishna to choose Arjuna as his charioteer in the war, and what was the significance of this decision?**\\n Retrieved Documents : should motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart.

Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are.

So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma.

This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community.

For instance, in the parva of the Bhishma Parva, Time is described as a force that causes every blade of grass to become a terrible bolt having the force of thunder. This example illustrates the destructive aspect of Time, where every creature is cooked in the cauldron of Time, leading to chaos and destruction.\\n\\nAnother example is the destruction of the Vrishnis, a group of heroes, through the Brahmanas' curse, which causes every blade of grass to become a terrible bolt having the force of thunder. This curse is a manifestation of Time's destructive power, where every creature is affected, leading to chaos and destruction.\\n\\n**Preserver Aspect:**\\n\\nOn the other hand, Time is also depicted as a preserver in the Mahabharata. For instance, in the parva of the Bhishma Parva, Time is described as a force that cooks every creature in the world, binding them with the cords of Time. This example illustrates the preserver aspect of Time, where every creature is preserved and sustained by Time's power.\\n\\nAnother example is the destruction of the Vrishnis through the Brahmanas' rod of chastisement, which is caused by the iron bolt wielded by the Kuru king Yudhishthira. This example illustrates the preserver aspect of Time, where Time's power is used to preserve the lives of individuals, but ultimately leads to destruction.\\n\\n**Examples from Different Parvas:**\\n\\nThe concept of Time (Kala) is also associated with the following examples from different parvas:\\n\\n- The destruction of the Vrishnis through the Brahmanas' curse in the Bhishma Parva.\\n- The destruction of the Vrishnis through the Brahmanas' rod of chastisement in the Bhishma Parva.\\n- The destruction of the Vrishnis through the iron bolt wielded by the Kuru king Yudhishthira in the Bhishma Parva.\\n- The preservation of the lives of individuals through Time's power in the Bhishma Parva.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of Time (Kala) in the Mahabharata is portrayed as both a destroyer and a preserver throughout the epic.

The sharing of responsibilities through decentralization will generate new ideas, innovative practices. This will help the team members to take responsibilities and grow higher.

Karna's loyalty to his family and society is evident in his vow to protect the throne and his efforts to help Drona. Arjuna's loyalty to his family and society is also evident in his repeated hearing of sweet words of men and women from his guru Yajnavalkya, which motivated him to perform auspicious rites in favor of the hero.\\n2. **Courage and Determination**: Both characters demonstrate courage and determination in the face of adversity. Karna's courage is evident in his vow to fight alongside the Pandavas despite being a Kaurava, while Arjuna's courage is evident in his repeated efforts to help his friends and family.\\n3. **Intelligence and Wisdom**: Both characters possess intelligence and wisdom, which guides their actions and decisions. Karna's intelligence and wisdom are evident in his ability to outmaneuver his opponents and his efforts to help Drona. Arjuna's intelligence and wisdom are evident in his repeated hearing of sweet words of men and women from his guru Yajnavalkya, which motivated him to perform auspicious rites in favor of the hero.\\n\\n**Differences:**\\n\\n1. **Personality Traits**: Karna's personality traits are more impulsive and emotional, while Arjuna's personality traits are more rational and selfless. Karna's tendency to follow his emotions often leads him to make mistakes, while Arjuna's tendency to follow his duty and responsibility leads him to make wise decisions.\\n2. **Motivations**: Karna's motivations are driven by his desire to prove himself and gain recognition, while Arjuna's motivations are driven by his sense of duty and responsibility. Karna's actions are guided by his sense of duty and responsibility, while Arjuna's actions are guided by his sense of duty and responsibility.\\n3. **Relationships**: Karna's relationships with his family and society are more complex and nuanced, while Arjuna's relationships with his family and society are more straightforward and uncomplicated. Karna's relationships with his family and society are marked by his loyalty and duty, while Arjuna's relationships with his family and society are marked by his selflessness and devotion.\\n\\n**Impact on the Epic's Themes:**\\n\\n1. **War and Loyalty**: The contrast between Karna and Arjuna's approaches to war highlights the importance of choosing the right individuals for the right job. Karna's impulsive and emotional nature makes him a poor warrior, while Arjuna's rational and selfless nature makes him a better warrior.\\n2. **Duty and Honor**: The contrast between Karna and Arjuna's approaches to duty and honor highlights the importance of following one's duty and responsibility. Karna's failure to live up to his promise to Arjuna serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of following one's duty and responsibility.\\n3. **Sacrifice and Selflessness**: The contrast between Karna and Arjuna's approaches to sacrifice and selflessness highlights the importance of putting the needs of others before one's own desires. Karna's selfless actions, such as helping Drona, serve as a contrast to Arjuna's more self-centered actions, such as fighting alongside the Pandavas.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the characters of Karna and Arjuna share similarities in their loyalty and duty, courage and determination, intelligence and wisdom, and complex relationships with their families and societies. However, they also have significant differences in their personality traits, motivations, and approaches to war, duty, and sacrifice. The contrast between their approaches highlights the importance of choosing the right individuals for the right job, following one's duty and responsibility, and putting the needs of others before one's own desires.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Compare and contrast the characters of Karna and Arjuna, analyzing their similarities, differences, and how their parallel journeys contribute to the epic's themes.\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"\\n\\n\\n Sub Question : Here are three search queries related to comparing and contrasting the characters of Karna and Arjuna:\\n Retrieved Documents : against Pandavas.

He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts.

According to the Q&A pairs, the fire was caused by Arjuna, who, along with Narayana, cast off Gandiva, a high-souled discus, and ignited the fire by doing so. This act was said to have been gratifying to the deity of fire, who was pleased with Arjuna's actions.\\n\\nThe immediate consequences of the fire were devastating. Arjuna's mother, the mother of his benefactor, was unable to save her from the fire, and the royal sage of Kuru's race, who was engaged in penances, was also killed by the fire. The fire was so intense that it burnt the mother of Arjuna, and it was also responsible for the death of the king and his two mothers.\\n\\nThe long-term consequences of the fire were severe. The forest was destroyed, and many animals, snakes, and boars were killed or displaced. The fire also caused air and water pollution, and the destruction of the forest and its inhabitants led to a general conflagration in the woods. The precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, was also destroyed.\\n\\nThe burning of the Khandava Forest was a tragic event that had far-reaching consequences. It was a devastating conflagration that destroyed the forest and its inhabitants, and it had significant environmental and social impacts. The event was also a result of Arjuna's inaction, which was gratifying to the deity of fire but ultimately led to the destruction of the forest and its inhabitants.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the events leading up to and including the burning of the Khandava Forest were complex and multifaceted.

There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson.

These women play crucial roles in the decision-making process, often serving as impartial and fair arbiters, and their actions have a profound impact on the outcome of the war.\\n\\nDraupadi, as the companion of the Pandavas, plays a significant role in binding them together for 14 years, demonstrating her dedication and loyalty to her family. Her influence is also evident in the war of Mahabharata, where she helps the Pandavas to win by her loyalty and impartiality.\\n\\nKunti, as the final decision maker, listens to everyone without questioning, including her daughter-in-law Panchali and her daughter Ulupi. Her feminine traits, such as being mild, self-restrained, and compassionate, help balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits of the Kauravas. Her decisions are not followed by the Kaurava camp, but everyone listens to her, and she plays a crucial role in binding the Pandavas together for 14 years.\\n\\nGandhari, as a mother, wife, and warrior, plays a pivotal role in guiding her sons, particularly Yudhishthira. Her influence is evident in her decision to leave Yudhishthira, which was a pivotal moment in the story. Her character highlights the importance of women in the Kaurava camp, as she was the only woman present in the decision-making process.\\n\\nThe epic reflects the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma, particularly in relation to the roles of these women.

They are often portrayed as strong and independent women who play crucial roles in the decision-making process, and their influence is evident in the epic's portrayal of their characters.\\n\\nThe epic highlights the importance of women's roles in decision-making, with Draupadi participating in the decision-making process and helping the Pandavas to win the war.

Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\n(King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\n\\\"He also beheld the princess of Pancala, decked in garlands of lotuses. Having attained to Heaven, she was sitting there, endued with a form possessed of solar splendour. King Yudhishthira suddenly wished to question her. Then the illustrious Indra, the chief of the gods, spoke to him, This one is Sree herself. It was for your sake that she took birth, as the daughter of Drupada, among human beings, issuing not from any mothers womb, O Yudhishthira, endued with agreeable perfume and capable of delighting the whole world. For your pleasure, she was created by the wielder of the trident. She was born in the race of Drupada and was enjoyed by you all. These five highly blessed Gandharvas endued with the effulgence of fire, and possessed of great energy, were, O king, the sons of Draupadi and yourself.\\n Answer : Draupadi played a significant role in the Mahabharata, particularly in the decision-making process.

Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals.

As a mother, she played a significant role in guiding her sons, particularly Yudhishthira, and was deeply affected by their decisions. Her influence was also evident in her decision to leave Yudhishthira, which was a pivotal moment in the story. Additionally, Gandhari's character highlights the importance of women in the Kaurava camp, as she was the only woman present in the decision-making process.\\n\\n\\n Sub Question : \\n Retrieved Documents : of the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight.

It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas.

Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n Answer : Bhishma's vow of celibacy and devotion to his father's happiness reflects the concept of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata's portrayal of the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Bhishma's decision to renounce sex for his father's happiness is a valiant attempt to fulfill his duty, but ultimately leads to a fatal consequence. This decision is a classic example of the tension between duty and personal desire, where Bhishma prioritizes his duty to his father over his personal desires.\\n\\n\\n Sub Question : \\n Retrieved Documents : of the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself.

In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas.

Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nLessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nBharata's race, gratified with thy behaviour? Dost thou, O king of kings,\\n\\nadore with devotion the Pitris and the deities? Dost thou worship guests\\n\\nwith food and drink, O Bharata? Do the Brahmanas in thy dominions,\\n\\ndevoted to the duties of their order, walk along the path of\\n\\nrighteousness? Do the Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras also within thy\\n\\nkingdom, and all thy relatives, observe their respective duties? I hope\\n\\nthe women, the children, and the old, among thy subjects, do not grieve\\n\\n(under distress) and do not beg (the necessaries of life). Are the ladies\\n\\nof thy household duly honoured in thy house, O best of men? I hope, O\\n\\nmonarch, that this race of royal sages, having obtained thee for their\\n\\nking, have not fallen away from fame and glory.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Unto the old king who said so, Yudhishthira,\\n\\nconversant with morality and justice, and well-skilled in acts and\\n\\nspeech, spoke as follows, putting some questions about his welfare.'\\n\\ncomes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context. If you do not change your decision making instinct with the context, prepare for a storm, prepare for the \\u201cMahabharata\\u201d.\\n Answer : These queries break down the input into sub-questions that can be answered independently, exploring different aspects of the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata.\\n\\nQuestion 1: Here are three search queries related to the input question:\\nAnswer 1: The search query seems to be related to the Mahabharata, specifically the concept of the triple aggregates of the three worlds (Heavens, Regions of Beatitude, and Sacred Fires) and the relationship between the son, grandson, and great-grandson.\\n\\nQuestion 2: \\nAnswer 2: The narrator of the story is Vyasa, the sage who is said to have been granted boons by the gods.\\n\\nQuestion 3: 1. \\\"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy relate to the theme of duty in the Mahabharata?\\\"\\nAnswer 3: Bhishma's vow of celibacy relates to the theme of duty in the Mahabharata because it represents a decision that prioritizes his father's happiness over his own desires and sense of duty.
