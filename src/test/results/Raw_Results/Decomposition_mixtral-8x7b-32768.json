This decision later became fatal when the kingdom was left without a king. His vow also led to his death at the hands of Shikhandi, who was reborn specifically to be the cause of Bhishma's death.

But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context. If you do not change your decision making instinct with the context, prepare for a storm, prepare for the \\u201cMahabharata\\u201d.\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness.

Each and everyone should be rewarded according to his contribution. This will encourage team members to work harder. Yudhishtra was asked by Yaksha to choose the life of one of his brothers.

Since he is alive Kunti is partially bereaved. Life of Nakula would partially bereaved the Madri at that time. Yaksha was impressed with the impartial decision of Yudhishthra and granted the life of all of four brothers of Yudhishtra. 3.18 Motivation Motivation is key of success.

In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nInference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently. Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\n(King).

Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers.

Initially, the Pandavas wagered their kingdom, then their wife Draupadi, and ultimately, they had to enter a 13-year exile followed by a year of incognito living. In the final round, they put everything at stake, leading to the great battle of Mahabharata. This illustrates the risk of increasing stakes, highlighting the importance of managing risk to avoid difficulties.\\n\\nQuestion 1: 1. \\\"What were the rules and conditions of the dice game in the Mahabharata between the Pandavas and Kauravas?\\\"\\nAnswer 1: The dice game in the Mahabharata between the Pandavas and Kauravas was played under the leadership of Sikhandin for the Pandavas and Bhishma for the Kauravas. Loyalty, impartiality, and commitment were significant factors in the war's outcome. The Pandavas, though less in number, won due to their unity, strategic planning, and dedication. The Kauravas had more weapons and physical force but lacked unity and commitment, leading to their defeat.\\n\\nQuestion 2: 2. \\\"What was the wager in the first round of the dice game between the Pandavas and Kauravas in the Mahabharata?\\\"\\nAnswer 2: The wager in the first round of the dice game between the Pandavas and Kauravas in the Mahabharata is not specified in the provided context. However, it is mentioned that a great battle between Arjuna and the Saindhavas took place in the territories of the Kauravas.\\n\\nQuestion 3: 3. \\\"How did the stakes increase with each round in the dice game of the Mahabharata between the Pandavas and Kauravas?\\\"\\nAnswer 3: With each round in the Mahabharata dice game, the stakes increased significantly.

As a charioteer, his role was to provide guidance and support to Arjuna. In contrast, when he took on a combatant role, he actively engaged in battles with various warriors.

Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nforemost of men, viz., king Yudhishthira, said unto the chief of the\\n\\nVrishnis that it was even so. The princess Draupadi, however, looked\\n\\nangrily and askance at Krishna, (for she could not bear the ascription of\\n\\nany fault to Arjuna). The slayer of Kesi, viz., Hrishikesa, approved of\\n\\nthat indication of love (for his friend) which the princess of Panchala,\\n\\nwho also was his friend, displayed.[204] Bhimasena and the other Kurus,\\n\\nincluding the sacrificial priests, who heard of the agreeable triumphs of\\n\\nArjuna in course of his following the horse, became highly gratified.\\n\\nWhile they were still engaged in discoursing on Arjuna, an envoy came\\n\\nfrom that high-souled hero bearing a message from him. Repairing to the\\n\\npresence of the Kuru king, the intelligent envoy bowed his head in\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n Answer : Krishna's choice to be Arjuna's charioteer in the Bhagavad Gita is significant because it demonstrates the importance of having the right person for the job, as Krishna's guidance helped Arjuna make the righteous decision to fight. This is an example of efficient utilization of potential and capabilities. Additionally, Krishna's role went beyond being a charioteer, as he also formulated strategies that led to the Pandavas' victory.\\n\\nQuestion 1: 1. \\\"Krishna's role as Arjuna's charioteer in Mahabharata: Reasons behind his decision\\\"\\nAnswer 1: Krishna, in the Mahabharata, took on the role of Arjuna's charioteer due to his dedication to a cause - the wellbeing of all, including the Pandavas and Kauravas. His decision was also influenced by strategic management principles, as illustrated when he advised Arjuna to cut off Jyadharatha's head in a specific way to avoid negative consequences. Krishna's strategic advice and motivation played a crucial role in the Pandavas' victory in the battle of Mahabharata.\\n\\nQuestion 2: 2. \\\"Difference between Krishna's roles as charioteer and combatant in the Kurukshetra war\\\"\\nAnswer 2: Krishna played a dual role in the Kurukshetra war, serving as a charioteer for Arjuna and also participating in combat when necessary. As a charioteer, his role was to provide guidance and support to Arjuna. In contrast, when he took on a combatant role, he actively engaged in battles with various warriors. The main difference lies in the nature of his involvement: as a charioteer, he was a supportive figure, while as a combatant, he was an active participant in the fighting.\\n\\nQuestion 3: 3. \\\"Significance of Krishna's choice to be Arjuna's charioteer in the Bhagavad Gita\\\"\\nAnswer 3: Krishna's choice to be Arjuna's charioteer in the Bhagavad Gita is significant because it demonstrates the importance of having the right person for the job, as Krishna's guidance helped Arjuna make the righteous decision to fight. This is an example of efficient utilization of potential and capabilities. Additionally, Krishna's role went beyond being a charioteer, as he also formulated strategies that led to the Pandavas' victory.\"]}": {
