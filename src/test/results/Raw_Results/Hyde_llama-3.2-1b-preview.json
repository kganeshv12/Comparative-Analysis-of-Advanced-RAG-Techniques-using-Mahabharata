Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava force\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\"]}": {

Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nforemost of men, viz., king Yudhishthira, said unto the chief of the\\n\\nVrishnis that it was even so. The princess Draupadi, however, looked\\n\\nangrily and askance at Krishna, (for she could not bear the ascription of\\n\\nany fault to Arjuna). The slayer of Kesi, viz., Hrishikesa, approved of\\n\\nthat indication of love (for his friend) which the princess of Panchala,\\n\\nwho also was his friend, displayed.[204] Bhimasena and the other Kurus,\\n\\nincluding the sacrificial priests, who heard of the agreeable triumphs of\\n\\nArjuna in course of his following the horse, became highly gratified.\\n\\nWhile they were still engaged in discoursing on Arjuna, an envoy came\\n\\nfrom that high-souled hero bearing a message from him. Repairing to the\\n\\npresence of the Kuru king, the intelligent envoy bowed his head in\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna.

The boon was to kill the Khandava, a demon who was said to be the son of the god Indra. Arjuna, however, was reluctant to fulfill the boon, as he was a devotee of the god Krishna and did not want to harm the demon.\\n\\nKrishna, who was pleased with Arjuna's devotion, decided to take on the form of a Brahmana and visit Arjuna in his village. Arjuna, disguising himself as a Brahmana, went to the village and met with the Khandava. The Khandava, who was a powerful demon, was initially hostile towards Arjuna, but eventually, he was convinced by Arjuna's words and agreed to fight him.\\n\\nThe battle between Arjuna and the Khandava was fierce, and both warriors fought valiantly. However, in the end, the Khandava was killed, and Arjuna was victorious.\\n\\nThe immediate consequences of the battle were the death of the Khandava and the destruction of the forest. The forest was burned, and many animals, including snakes and boars, were killed. The king of the forest, who had been living in the woods, was also killed.\\n\\nThe long-term consequences of the battle were the death of the king of the forest, who had taken no food and was unable to move. The king's two mothers, who had been emaciated, were also unable to move. The king's death was a result of the destruction of the forest and the killing of many animals.\\n\\nThe text also mentions that the king's two mothers, who had been emaciated, were unable to move, and that the king's death was a result of the destruction of the forest and the killing of many animals. This suggests that the destruction of the forest and the killing of many animals had a devastating impact on the king's family and the ecosystem of the forest.\\n\\nOverall, the events leading up to and including the burning of the Khandava Forest were a tragic and devastating event that had far-reaching consequences for the king's family and the ecosystem of the forest.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Describe the events leading up to and including the burning of the Khandava Forest.

Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\\n\\nproceeded to a spot on the margin of Ganga. He then bathed in the sacred\\n\\nstream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.\\n\\nThe wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to\\n\\nburn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt\\n\\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\\n\\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\\n\\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\\n\\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\\n\\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,\\n\\nexceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the\\n\\nconflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,\\n\\nthat foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,--'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a\\n\\nplace where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nbanks of Ganga. United with that (sacred) fire of his own, O chief of the\\n\\nBharatas, the king, as I have already said unto thee, met with death on\\n\\nthe banks of Ganga. O sinless one, this is what the ascetics have told\\n\\nme,--those, viz., whom I saw on the banks of the sacred Bhagirathi, O\\n\\nYudhishthira. Thus O lord of Earth, king Dhritarashtra, coming into\\n\\ncontact with his own sacred fire, departed from this world and attained\\n\\nto that high goal that has been his. Through service rendered by her to\\n\\nher seniors, thy mother, O lord of men, has attained to very great\\n\\nsuccess. There is not the slightest doubt of this. It behoveth thee, O\\n\\nking of kings, to now discharge the rites of water to their honour, with\\n\\nall thy brothers. Let, therefore, the necessary steps be taken towards\\n\\nthat end.'\\n\\nbare ground through the acts of my sinful self. I do not grieve for the\\n\\nfamous Gandhari who had been deprived of all her children. Observing the\\n\\nsame vows as her husband, she has attained to those very regions which\\n\\nhave become his. I grieve, however, for Pritha who, abandoning the\\n\\nblazing prosperity of her sons, became desirous of residing in the woods.\\n\\nFie on this sovereignty of ours, fie on our prowess, fie on the practices\\n\\nof Kshatriyas! Though alive, we are really dead! O foremost of superior\\n\\nBrahmanas, the course of Time is very subtle and difficult to understand,\\n\\ninasmuch as Kunti, abandoning sovereignty, became desirous of taking up\\n\\nher abode in the forest. How is it that she who was the mother of\\n\\nYudhishthira, of Bhima, of Vijaya, was burnt to deathlike a helpless\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts.

The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma.

Bhishma's decision to renounce sex for his father's happiness is a classic example of duty. He prioritizes his duty to his father and his family over his personal desires, which are not explicitly stated. This decision is motivated by his love and loyalty to his father, and he believes that his actions will bring him happiness and fulfillment.\\n\\nIn contrast, Bhishma's decision to walk away from his vow of celibacy and marry Satyavati is a reflection of personal desire. He is torn between his duty to his father and his personal desires, and ultimately decides to follow his heart. This decision is driven by his own desires and emotions, rather than a sense of duty or obligation.\\n\\nThe theme of duty versus personal desire is a central theme in the Mahabharata. The epic explores the complexities of human nature and the challenges of balancing personal desires with moral obligations. Bhishma's story serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of prioritizing personal desires over duty, and the importance of living up to one's moral obligations.\\n\\nIn the context of the Mahabharata, Bhishma's vow of celibacy is a symbol of his commitment to his family and his community. He is willing to sacrifice his personal desires for the sake of his family and his community, demonstrating his dedication to duty and his sense of responsibility.\\n\\nBhishma's story also highlights the importance of selflessness and sacrifice. He is willing to give up his own desires and happiness for the sake of others, demonstrating his commitment to the greater good.

The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru.

He stood, having\\n\\nrecourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like\\n\\none deprived of life.

Endued with great energy,\\n\\nKetuvarman, the younger brother of Suryavarman, and possessed of youthful\\n\\nvigour, fought, for the sake of his brother, against Pandu's son\\n\\npossessed of great fame.

Beholding that lightness of hand displayed by\\n\\nthe youth Dhritavarman, Gudakesa of mighty energy and great prowess\\n\\nbecame highly gratified with him. The son of Indra could not see when the\\n\\nyoung warrior took out his arrows and when he placed them on his\\n\\nbow-string aiming at him. He only saw showers of arrows in the air. For a\\n\\nbrief space of time, Arjuna gladdened his enemy and mentally admired his\\n\\nwelkin itself with those shafts of his coursing through the welkin. The\\n\\nson of Bhagadatta, beholding his broad-headed shafts thus cut off,\\n\\nquickly sped at Arjuna a number of other arrows in a continuous line.\\n\\nFilled with rage at this, Arjuna, more quickly than before, shot at\\n\\nBhagadatta's son a number of straightly coursing arrows equipt with\\n\\ngolden wings. Vajradatta of mighty energy, struck with great force and\\n\\npierced with these arrows in that fierce encounter, fell down on the\\n\\nEarth. Consciousness, however, did not desert him. Mounting on his prince\\n\\nof elephants again in the midst of that battle the son of Bhagadatta,\\n\\ndesirous of victory, very coolly sped a number of shafts at Arjuna.\\n\\nFilled with wrath, Jishnu then sped at the prince a number of arrows that\\n\\nlooked like blazing flames of fire and that seemed to be so many snakes\\n\\nof virulent poison. Pierced therewith, the mighty elephant, emitting a\\n\\nlarge quantity of blood, looked like a mountain of many springs\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon.

The role of women in the Mahabharata is multifaceted and significant, with Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari playing crucial roles in shaping the narrative.\\n\\n**Draupadi: The Symbol of Dharma**\\n\\nDraupadi, the wife of Pandava Yudhishthira, is often seen as a symbol of dharma, or righteousness. Her actions and choices drive the narrative and reflect the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma.
