There are diverse other kinds of\\n\\nheroes that practise diverse other kinds of vows and observances. There\\n\\nare heroes devoted to the study of the Vedas and heroes devoted to the\\n\\nteaching of the same. There are, again, men that come to be regarded as\\n\\nheroes for the devotion with which they wait upon and serve their\\n\\npreceptors, as indeed, heroes in respect of the reverence they show to\\n\\ntheir sires. There are heroes in respect of obedience to mothers, and\\n\\nheroes in the matter of the life of mendicancy they lead. There are\\n\\nheroes in the matter of hospitality to guests, whether living as\\n\\nhouseholders. All these heroes attain to very superior, regions of\\n\\nfelicity which are, of course, acquired by them as the rewards of their\\n\\nown acts. Holding all the Vedas in memory, or ablutions performed in all\\n\\nthe sacred waters, may or may not be equal to telling the Truth every day\\n\\nin one's life. A thousand horse sacrifices and Truth were once weighed in\\n\\nthe balance. It was seen that Truth weighed heavier than a thousand\\n\\nhorse-sacrifices. It is by Truth that the sun is imparting heat, it is by\\n\\nTruth that fire blazes up, it is by Truth that the winds blow; verily,\\n\\neverything rests upon Truth. It is Truth that gratifies the deities, the\\n\\nPitris and the Brahmanas. Truth has been said to be the highest duty.\\n\\nTherefore, no one should ever transgress Truth. The Munis are all devoted\\n\\nto Truth. Their prowess depends upon Truth. They also swear by Truth.\\n\\nHence, Truth is pre-eminent. All truthful men, O chief of Bharata's race,\\n\\nsucceed by their truthfulness in attaining to heaven and sporting there\\n\\nin felicity. Self-restraint is the attainment of the reward that attaches\\n\\nto Truth. I have discoursed on it with my whole heart. The man of humble\\n\\nheart who is possessed of self-restraint, without doubt, attains to great\\n\\nhonours in heaven. Listen now to me, O lord of Earth, as I expound to\\n\\nthee the merits of Brahmacharya. That man, who practises the vow of\\n\\nBrahmacharya from his birth to the time of his death, know, O king, has\\n\\nnothing unattainable! Many millions of Rishis are residing in the region\\n\\nof Brahma. All of them, while here, were devoted to Truth, and\\n\\nself-restrained and had their vital seed drawn up. The vow of\\n\\nBrahmacharya, O king, duly observed by a Brahmana, is sure to burn all\\n\\nhis sins. The Brahmana is said to be a blazing fire. In those Brahmanas\\n\\nthat are devoted to penances, the deity of fire becomes visible. If a\\n\\nBrahmacharin yields to wrath in consequence of any slight the chief of\\n\\nthe deities himself trembles in fear. Even this is the visible fruit of\\n\\nthe vow of Brahmacharya that is observed by the Rishis. Listen to me, O\\n\\nYudhishthira, what the merit is that attaches to the worship of the\\n\\nfather and the mother. He, who dutifully serves his father without ever\\n\\ncrossing him in anything, or similarly serves his mother or (elder)\\n\\nbrother or other senior or preceptor, it should be known, O king, earns a\\n\\nresidence in heaven. The man of cleansed soul, in consequence of such\\n\\nservice rendered to his seniors, has never even to behold hell.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXVI\\n\\n\\\"Yudhishthira said, 'I desire, O king, to hear thee discourse in detail\\n\\nupon those high ordinances which regulate gifts of kine, for it is by\\n\\nmaking gifts (of kine) according to those ordinances that one attains to\\n\\ninnumerable regions of eternal felicity.'\\n\\n\\\"Bhishma said, 'There is no gift, O lord of Earth, that is higher in\\n\\npoint of merit than the gift of kine. A cow, lawfully acquired, if given\\n\\naway, immediately rescues the whole race of the giver. That ritual which\\n\\nsprang for the benefit of the righteous, was subsequently declared for\\n\\nthe sake of all creatures.

If words alone could lead\\n\\nto success, then with thee, O son of Radha, as his protector, this bull\\n\\namong the Kurus would be considered to have the amplest measure of\\n\\nprotection. Thou boastest much, O Karna, in the presence of the Kuru\\n\\nchief, but thy prowess is seldom witnessed, nor, indeed, any result (of\\n\\nthy boastful speeches). Many a time have we seen thee encounter the sons\\n\\nof Pandu in battle. On every one of those occasions, O Suta's son, thou\\n\\nhast been vanquished by the Pandavas. While Dhritarashtra's son was being\\n\\ntaken away (as a captive) by the Gandharvas, all the troops fought on\\n\\nthat occasion except thy single self, who was the first to fly away. In\\n\\nVirata's city also, all the Kauravas, united together, including thyself\\n\\nand thy younger brother were vanquished by Partha in battle. Thou art not\\n\\na match for even one of the sons of Pandu, viz., Phalguna, on the field\\n\\nof battle. How then canst thou venture to vanquish all the sons of Pandu\\n\\nwith Krishna at their head? Thou indulgest in too much brag, O Suta's\\n\\nson! Engage thyself in battle without saying anything. To Put forth\\n\\nprowess without indulging in brag is the duty of good men. Ever roaring\\n\\naloud, O Suta's son like the dry clouds of autumn, thou showest thyself,\\n\\nO Karna to be without substance. The king, however, does not understand\\n\\nit. Thou roarest, O son of Radha, as long as thou seest not the son of\\n\\nPritha. These thy roars disappear when thou seest Partha near. Indeed,\\n\\nthou roarest as long as thou art out of the range of Phalguna's shafts.\\n\\nThose roars of thine disappear when thou art pierced with Partha's\\n\\nshafts. Kshatriyas evince their eminence by means of their arms;\\n\\nBrahmanas, by means of speech; Arjuna evinces his by means of the bow;\\n\\nbut Karna, by the castles he builds in the air. Who is there that will\\n\\nresist that Partha who gratified Rudra himself (in battle)?' Thus railed\\n\\nat by Saradwat's son, Karna, that foremost of smiters, answered Kripa in\\n\\nthe following strain, 'Heroes always roar like clouds in the season of\\n\\nrains, and like steeds put in the soil, quickly yield fruits. I do not\\n\\nsee any fault in heroes that take great burdens on their shoulders,\\n\\nindulging in boastful speeches on the field of battle. When a person\\n\\nmentally resolves to bear a burden, Destiny itself aids him in the\\n\\nexecution. Wishing in my heart bear a great burden, I always summon\\n\\nsufficient resolution. If, slaying the sons of Pandu with Krishna and\\n\\nSatwatas in battle, I indulge in such roars, what is it to thee, O\\n\\nBrahmana? They that are heroes never roar fruitlessly like autumnal\\n\\nclouds. Conscious of their own might, the wise indulge in roars! In my\\n\\nheart I am determined to vanquish in battle today Krishna and Partha\\n\\nunited together and fighting with resolution! It is for this that I roar,\\n\\nO son of Gotama! Behold the fruit of these my roars, O Brahmana! Slaying\\n\\nthe son of Pandu in battle, with all their followers, Krishna and\\n\\nSatwatas, I will bestow on Duryodhana the whole earth without a thorn in\\n\\nit.'\\n\\n\\\"Kripa said, 'Little do I reckon, O Suta's son, these delirious saying of\\n\\nthine discovering thy thoughts, not deeds. Thou always speakest in\\n\\ndepreciation of the two Krishnas and king Yudhishthira the just. He, O\\n\\nKarna, is certain, to have the victory who hath on his side those two\\n\\nheroes skilled in battle. Indeed, Krishna and Arjuna are incapable of\\n\\nbeing defeated by the celestials, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, human\\n\\nbeings, the Nagas, and the birds, all clad in mail. Yudhishthira, the son\\n\\nof Dharma is devoted to the Brahmanas. He is truthful in speech and\\n\\nself-restrained. He reverences the Pitris and the deities. He is devoted\\n\\nto the practice of truth and righteousness. He is, again, skilled in\\n\\nweapons. Possessed of great intelligence, he is also grateful. His\"]}": {

Her decision to marry Arjuna despite being a widow and her subsequent actions in the war demonstrate her loyalty and commitment to her family and her husband.\\n\\n2. **Kunti**: As the supreme authority and the mother of the Pandavas, Kunti's actions and choices are significant in the epic. She is a wise and just woman who guides her sons and supports them throughout the war. Her decision to allow Arjuna to marry her daughter Draupadi despite the fact that she is a widow is a testament to her love and devotion.\\n\\n3. **Gandhari**: As the wife of Pandu and the mother of the Pandavas, Gandhari's actions and choices are also crucial in the epic. She is a strong and intelligent woman who plays a significant role in the war. Her decision to support her sons and her husband despite the fact that she is a widow is a testament to her love and devotion.\\n\\nThe actions and choices of these women drive the narrative and reflect the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma.

At that time Pandavas actions were very qualitative due to able guidance of Krishna which lead Pandavas towards success. 3.12 Right Mentoring In every difficult task, one has to seek advise of mentors. It is always advisable to choose a right person for this purpose who can show you the right path. The success of Pandavas was due to the guidance and continuous touch as well as support of Krishna, Bhishma, Vidura and other such dignitaries. Good managers must guide their subordinates effectively for growth of their organizations. 3.13 Understanding and Analyzing situations Features of good management are to perceive and deeply analyze the situation from small gestures. Duryodhna planned to kill all the Pandavas in Lakshagraha, but Vidura as their well wisher secretary conveyed the message to them. It was the intelligence of Pandavas who were able to understand his indirect message for them. Hence, they could save their lives. Promoters and management of a firm should know the market situations, perceptions of the consumers, investors etc but on the other hand Pandavas paid due regard to their values and truthfulness. This was the cause of their success mantra. Similarly, all management practices must be started with ethics. Initially, we may be in difficult situation but in long run we will be rewarded. Good ethical practices in a business can attract all the stakeholders. We can gain more goodwill, large number of customers, suppliers and high profitability. Institutes like Infosys are known for their trust and moral values. 3.14 Practice Arjuna has perfection in his work due to practice and experience. Karana also possessed the art of targeting arrow perfectly due to his continuous practice. They focused on their goals. It was regular practice, dedication and commitment of Arjuna which made him powerful during war and he defeated great warriors of Kauravas. After the loss of their kingdom, Pandavas tried to work on their weaknesses and learned new skills. Arjuna utilized the time during their exile to acquire new weapons. Yudhishthra acquired teachings from various Rishis and learned the game of dice. Business promoters must experience their products and plans in order to survive in long run. They need to concentrate on continuous improvement for the success of business. 3.15 Women empowerment Women empowerment means participation of women in decision making. Participation of women in decision making helps to view the situation in holistic way. Harmonious, feminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded according to his contribution. This will encourage team members to work harder. Yudhishtra was asked by Yaksha to choose the life of one of his brothers. He had chosen Nakul at that time because his two brothers Bhima and Arjun were born to Kunti and other two Nakula and Sahadeva to his father\\u2019s second wife Madri. Since he is alive Kunti is partially bereaved. Life of Nakula would partially bereaved the Madri at that time. Yaksha was impressed with the impartial decision of Yudhishthra and\"]}": {

And in the\\n\\nnorthern Paripatra mountains, all beings had sung, saying,--The\\n\\nprosperity (of this race), robbed by foes will be recovered by this one\\n\\nwithout delay. No one will be able to vanquish him in battle, while there\\n\\nwill be none whom he will not be able to vanquish. Why then hath that\\n\\nJishnu endued with great strength been subject to death?

Why have those heroes,\\n\\nthose mighty sons of Kunti, Bhimasena and Dhananjaya, came under the\\n\\npower of the enemy,--those who themselves always slew their foes, and\\n\\nwhom no weapons could resist! Surely, this vile heart of mine must be\\n\\nmade of adamant, since, beholding these twins lying today on the ground\\n\\nit doth not split! Ye bulls among men, versed in holy writ and acquainted\\n\\nwith the properties of time and place, and endued with ascetic merit, ye\\n\\nwho duly performed all sacred rites, why lie ye down, without performing\\n\\nacts deserving of you? Alas, why lie ye insensible on the earth, with\\n\\nyour bodies unwounded, ye unvanquished ones, and with your vows\\n\\nuntouched?'

It hath\\n\\nbeen heard, O king, in the Purana that there was a celebrated king of the\\n\\nname of Swetaki who was endued with strength and prowess and who was\\n\\nequal unto Indra himself. No one on earth has equalled him in sacrifices,\\n\\ncharity, and intelligence. Swetaki performed the five great sacrifices\\n\\nand many others, at all of which the presents unto Brahmanas were large.\\n\\nThe heart of that monarch, O king, was always set upon sacrifices,\\n\\nreligious rites, and gifts of all kinds. And king Swetaki of great\\n\\nintelligence, assisted by his Ritwiks performed sacrifices for many long\\n\\nyears, till those sacrificial priests with eyes afflicted by the\\n\\ncontinued smoke and becoming very weak, left that monarch, wishing never\\n\\nmore to assist at his sacrifices. The king, however, repeatedly asked\\n\\nthose Ritwiks to come to him. But they came not to his sacrifice in\\n\\nconsequence of the painful state of their eyes. The king, therefore,\\n\\ninvited at the command of his own Ritwiks, others like unto them, and\\n\\ncompleted the sacrifice that he had begun. After some days had elapsed,\\n\\nking Swetaki desired to perform another sacrifice which should extend for\\n\\na hundred years. But the illustrious monarch obtained not any priest to\\n\\nassist him in it. The celebrated king then, with his friends and\\n\\nrelatives, casting off all sloth, repeatedly courted his priests with\\n\\ngreat persistence, by bowing down unto them, by conciliatory speeches,\\n\\nand by gifts of wealth. All of them, however, refused to accomplish the\\n\\npurpose which that king of immeasurable energy had in view. Then that\\n\\nroyal sage, getting angry, addressed those Brahmanas sitting in their\\n\\nasylums, and said, 'If, ye Brahmanas, I were a fallen person, or, if, I\\n\\nwere wanting in homage and service to you, I should then deserve to be\\n\\nabandoned without scruple by you and by other Brahmanas at the same time.\\n\\nBut as I am neither degraded nor wanting in homage to you, it behoveth\\n\\nyou not to obstruct the performance by me of my sacrifice or to abandon\\n\\nme thus, ye foremost of Brahmanas, without adequate reason. I seek, ye\\n\\nBrahmanas, your protection! It behoveth you to be propitious unto me.\\n\\nBut, ye foremost of Brahmanas, if you abandon me from enmity alone or any\\n\\nimproper motive, I shall go unto other priests for their assistance in\\n\\nthis sacrifice of mine, and conciliating them by sweet words and gifts, I\\n\\nshall represent unto them the business I have on hand, so that they may\\n\\naccomplish it.' Having said this, the monarch became silent. And, O\\n\\nchastiser of foes, when those priests well knew that they could not\\n\\nassist at the king's sacrifice, they pretended to be angry, and\\n\\naddressing that best of monarchs said, 'O best of kings, thy sacrifices\\n\\nare incessant! By assisting thee always, we have all been fatigued. And\\n\\nas we have been wearied in consequence of these labours, it behoveth thee\\n\\nto give us leave. O sinless one, from loss of judgment thou canst not\\n\\nwait (but urgest us repeatedly). Go unto Rudra! He will assist at thy\\n\\nsacrifice!' Hearing those words of censure and wrath, king Swetaki became\\n\\nangry. And the monarch wending to the mountains of Kailasa, devoted\\n\\nhimself to asceticism there. And, O king, the monarch began to worship\\n\\nMahadeva, with fixed attention, and by observing the most rigid vows. And\\n\\nforegoing all food at times, he passed a long period.

If words alone could lead\\n\\nto success, then with thee, O son of Radha, as his protector, this bull\\n\\namong the Kurus would be considered to have the amplest measure of\\n\\nprotection. Thou boastest much, O Karna, in the presence of the Kuru\\n\\nchief, but thy prowess is seldom witnessed, nor, indeed, any result (of\\n\\nthy boastful speeches). Many a time have we seen thee encounter the sons\\n\\nof Pandu in battle. On every one of those occasions, O Suta's son, thou\\n\\nhast been vanquished by the Pandavas. While Dhritarashtra's son was being\\n\\ntaken away (as a captive) by the Gandharvas, all the troops fought on\\n\\nthat occasion except thy single self, who was the first to fly away. In\\n\\nVirata's city also, all the Kauravas, united together, including thyself\\n\\nand thy younger brother were vanquished by Partha in battle. Thou art not\\n\\na match for even one of the sons of Pandu, viz., Phalguna, on the field\\n\\nof battle. How then canst thou venture to vanquish all the sons of Pandu\\n\\nwith Krishna at their head? Thou indulgest in too much brag, O Suta's\\n\\nson! Engage thyself in battle without saying anything. To Put forth\\n\\nprowess without indulging in brag is the duty of good men. Ever roaring\\n\\naloud, O Suta's son like the dry clouds of autumn, thou showest thyself,\\n\\nO Karna to be without substance. The king, however, does not understand\\n\\nit. Thou roarest, O son of Radha, as long as thou seest not the son of\\n\\nPritha. These thy roars disappear when thou seest Partha near. Indeed,\\n\\nthou roarest as long as thou art out of the range of Phalguna's shafts.\\n\\nThose roars of thine disappear when thou art pierced with Partha's\\n\\nshafts. Kshatriyas evince their eminence by means of their arms;\\n\\nBrahmanas, by means of speech; Arjuna evinces his by means of the bow;\\n\\nbut Karna, by the castles he builds in the air. Who is there that will\\n\\nresist that Partha who gratified Rudra himself (in battle)?' Thus railed\\n\\nat by Saradwat's son, Karna, that foremost of smiters, answered Kripa in\\n\\nthe following strain, 'Heroes always roar like clouds in the season of\\n\\nrains, and like steeds put in the soil, quickly yield fruits. I do not\\n\\nsee any fault in heroes that take great burdens on their shoulders,\\n\\nindulging in boastful speeches on the field of battle. When a person\\n\\nmentally resolves to bear a burden, Destiny itself aids him in the\\n\\nexecution. Wishing in my heart bear a great burden, I always summon\\n\\nsufficient resolution. If, slaying the sons of Pandu with Krishna and\\n\\nSatwatas in battle, I indulge in such roars, what is it to thee, O\\n\\nBrahmana? They that are heroes never roar fruitlessly like autumnal\\n\\nclouds. Conscious of their own might, the wise indulge in roars! In my\\n\\nheart I am determined to vanquish in battle today Krishna and Partha\\n\\nunited together and fighting with resolution! It is for this that I roar,\\n\\nO son of Gotama! Behold the fruit of these my roars, O Brahmana! Slaying\\n\\nthe son of Pandu in battle, with all their followers, Krishna and\\n\\nSatwatas, I will bestow on Duryodhana the whole earth without a thorn in\\n\\nit.'\\n\\n\\\"Kripa said, 'Little do I reckon, O Suta's son, these delirious saying of\\n\\nthine discovering thy thoughts, not deeds. Thou always speakest in\\n\\ndepreciation of the two Krishnas and king Yudhishthira the just. He, O\\n\\nKarna, is certain, to have the victory who hath on his side those two\\n\\nheroes skilled in battle.

And beholding Arjuna lying\\n\\ndead, with his bow and arrows dropped on the ground, and also Bhimasena\\n\\nand the twins motionless and deprived of life, the king breathed a hot\\n\\nand long sigh, and was bathed in tears of grief. And beholding his\\n\\nbrothers lying dead, the mighty armed son of Dharma with heart racked in\\n\\nanxiety, began to lament profusely, saying, 'Thou hadst, O mighty-armed\\n\\nVrikodara, vowed, saying,--I shall with mace smash the thighs of\\n\\nDuryodhana in battle!

And in the\\n\\nnorthern Paripatra mountains, all beings had sung, saying,--The\\n\\nprosperity (of this race), robbed by foes will be recovered by this one\\n\\nwithout delay. No one will be able to vanquish him in battle, while there\\n\\nwill be none whom he will not be able to vanquish. Why then hath that\\n\\nJishnu endued with great strength been subject to death? Oh, why doth\\n\\nthat Dhananjaya, relying on whom we had hitherto endured all this misery,\\n\\nlie on the ground blighting[108] all my hopes! Why have those heroes,\\n\\nthose mighty sons of Kunti, Bhimasena and Dhananjaya, came under the\\n\\npower of the enemy,--those who themselves always slew their foes, and\\n\\nwhom no weapons could resist! Surely, this vile heart of mine must be\\n\\nmade of adamant, since, beholding these twins lying today on the ground\\n\\nit doth not split! Ye bulls among men, versed in holy writ and acquainted\\n\\nwith the properties of time and place, and endued with ascetic merit, ye\\n\\nwho duly performed all sacred rites, why lie ye down, without performing\\n\\nacts deserving of you? Alas, why lie ye insensible on the earth, with\\n\\nyour bodies unwounded, ye unvanquished ones, and with your vows\\n\\nuntouched?' And beholding his brothers sweetly sleeping there as (they\\n\\nusually did) on mountain slopes, the high souled king, overwhelmed with\\n\\ngrief and bathed in sweat, came to a distressful condition.

In those Brahmanas\\n\\nthat are devoted to penances, the deity of fire becomes visible. If a\\n\\nBrahmacharin yields to wrath in consequence of any slight the chief of\\n\\nthe deities himself trembles in fear. Even this is the visible fruit of\\n\\nthe vow of Brahmacharya that is observed by the Rishis. Listen to me, O\\n\\nYudhishthira, what the merit is that attaches to the worship of the\\n\\nfather and the mother. He, who dutifully serves his father without ever\\n\\ncrossing him in anything, or similarly serves his mother or (elder)\\n\\nbrother or other senior or preceptor, it should be known, O king, earns a\\n\\nresidence in heaven. The man of cleansed soul, in consequence of such\\n\\nservice rendered to his seniors, has never even to behold hell.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXVI\\n\\n\\\"Yudhishthira said, 'I desire, O king, to hear thee discourse in detail\\n\\nupon those high ordinances which regulate gifts of kine, for it is by\\n\\nmaking gifts (of kine) according to those ordinances that one attains to\\n\\ninnumerable regions of eternal felicity.'\\n\\n\\\"Bhishma said, 'There is no gift, O lord of Earth, that is higher in\\n\\npoint of merit than the gift of kine. A cow, lawfully acquired, if given\\n\\naway, immediately rescues the whole race of the giver. That ritual which\\n\\nsprang for the benefit of the righteous, was subsequently declared for\\n\\nthe sake of all creatures. That ritual has come down from primeval time.\\n\\nIt existed even before it was declared. Verily, O king, listen to me as I\\n\\nrecite to thee that ritual which affects the gift of kine.[366] In days\"]}": {

She is depicted as a strong and independent woman who plays a crucial role in the war. Her decision to marry Arjuna despite being a widow and her subsequent actions in the war demonstrate her commitment to her family and her duty as a wife and mother.\\n\\n2. **Kunti**: As the supreme authority and the mother of Pandavas, Kunti's actions and choices are pivotal in the epic. She is depicted as a wise and just woman who prioritizes the well-being of her children and the kingdom. Her decision to allow Arjuna to marry her daughter Draupadi, despite the fact that Draupadi is not yet married, reflects her commitment to her family and her values.\\n\\n3. **Gandhari**: As the wife of Pandava Yudhishthira, Gandhari's actions and choices are significant in the epic. She is depicted as a loyal and supportive wife who plays a crucial role in the war. Her decision to support Yudhishthira and her actions in the war demonstrate her commitment to her family and her duty as a wife and mother.\\n\\nIn terms of their actions and choices, the following points can be highlighted:\\n\\n- **Participation in decision-making**: Women in the Mahabharata, particularly Draupadi and Gandhari, participate in decision-making processes, which reflects the epic's views on women's empowerment and their role in society.\\n- **Loyalty and commitment**: Women in the epic, such as Gandhari and Kunti, demonstrate loyalty and commitment to their families and their duties, which is a key aspect of the epic's themes.\\n- **Impartiality and fairness**: Women in the epic, such as Draupadi, demonstrate impartiality and fairness in their actions and decisions, which is a key aspect of the epic's themes.\\n- **Role in the war**: Women in the epic, such as Gandhari and Kunti, play a significant role in the war, demonstrating their commitment to their families and their duty as wives and mothers.\\n\\nOverall, the role of women in the Mahabharata is multifaceted and significant, reflecting the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Examine the role of women in the Mahabharata, focusing on Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari.

At that time Pandavas actions were very qualitative due to able guidance of Krishna which lead Pandavas towards success. 3.12 Right Mentoring In every difficult task, one has to seek advise of mentors. It is always advisable to choose a right person for this purpose who can show you the right path. The success of Pandavas was due to the guidance and continuous touch as well as support of Krishna, Bhishma, Vidura and other such dignitaries. Good managers must guide their subordinates effectively for growth of their organizations. 3.13 Understanding and Analyzing situations Features of good management are to perceive and deeply analyze the situation from small gestures. Duryodhna planned to kill all the Pandavas in Lakshagraha, but Vidura as their well wisher secretary conveyed the message to them. It was the intelligence of Pandavas who were able to understand his indirect message for them. Hence, they could save their lives. Promoters and management of a firm should know the market situations, perceptions of the consumers, investors etc but on the other hand Pandavas paid due regard to their values and truthfulness. This was the cause of their success mantra. Similarly, all management practices must be started with ethics. Initially, we may be in difficult situation but in long run we will be rewarded. Good ethical practices in a business can attract all the stakeholders. We can gain more goodwill, large number of customers, suppliers and high profitability. Institutes like Infosys are known for their trust and moral values. 3.14 Practice Arjuna has perfection in his work due to practice and experience. Karana also possessed the art of targeting arrow perfectly due to his continuous practice. They focused on their goals. It was regular practice, dedication and commitment of Arjuna which made him powerful during war and he defeated great warriors of Kauravas. After the loss of their kingdom, Pandavas tried to work on their weaknesses and learned new skills. Arjuna utilized the time during their exile to acquire new weapons. Yudhishthra acquired teachings from various Rishis and learned the game of dice. Business promoters must experience their products and plans in order to survive in long run. They need to concentrate on continuous improvement for the success of business. 3.15 Women empowerment Women empowerment means participation of women in decision making. Participation of women in decision making helps to view the situation in holistic way. Harmonious, feminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded according to his contribution. This will encourage team members to work harder. Yudhishtra was asked by Yaksha to choose the life of one of his brothers. He had chosen Nakul at that time because his two brothers Bhima and Arjun were born to Kunti and other two Nakula and Sahadeva to his father\\u2019s second wife Madri. Since he is alive Kunti is partially bereaved. Life of Nakula would partially bereaved the Madri at that time. Yaksha was impressed with the impartial decision of Yudhishthra and\"]}": {

It hath\\n\\nbeen heard, O king, in the Purana that there was a celebrated king of the\\n\\nname of Swetaki who was endued with strength and prowess and who was\\n\\nequal unto Indra himself. No one on earth has equalled him in sacrifices,\\n\\ncharity, and intelligence. Swetaki performed the five great sacrifices\\n\\nand many others, at all of which the presents unto Brahmanas were large.\\n\\nThe heart of that monarch, O king, was always set upon sacrifices,\\n\\nreligious rites, and gifts of all kinds. And king Swetaki of great\\n\\nintelligence, assisted by his Ritwiks performed sacrifices for many long\\n\\nyears, till those sacrificial priests with eyes afflicted by the\\n\\ncontinued smoke and becoming very weak, left that monarch, wishing never\\n\\nmore to assist at his sacrifices. The king, however, repeatedly asked\\n\\nthose Ritwiks to come to him. But they came not to his sacrifice in\\n\\nconsequence of the painful state of their eyes. The king, therefore,\\n\\ninvited at the command of his own Ritwiks, others like unto them, and\\n\\ncompleted the sacrifice that he had begun. After some days had elapsed,\\n\\nking Swetaki desired to perform another sacrifice which should extend for\\n\\na hundred years. But the illustrious monarch obtained not any priest to\\n\\nassist him in it. The celebrated king then, with his friends and\\n\\nrelatives, casting off all sloth, repeatedly courted his priests with\\n\\ngreat persistence, by bowing down unto them, by conciliatory speeches,\\n\\nand by gifts of wealth. All of them, however, refused to accomplish the\\n\\npurpose which that king of immeasurable energy had in view. Then that\\n\\nroyal sage, getting angry, addressed those Brahmanas sitting in their\\n\\nasylums, and said, 'If, ye Brahmanas, I were a fallen person, or, if, I\\n\\nwere wanting in homage and service to you, I should then deserve to be\\n\\nabandoned without scruple by you and by other Brahmanas at the same time.\\n\\nBut as I am neither degraded nor wanting in homage to you, it behoveth\\n\\nyou not to obstruct the performance by me of my sacrifice or to abandon\\n\\nme thus, ye foremost of Brahmanas, without adequate reason. I seek, ye\\n\\nBrahmanas, your protection! It behoveth you to be propitious unto me.\\n\\nBut, ye foremost of Brahmanas, if you abandon me from enmity alone or any\\n\\nimproper motive, I shall go unto other priests for their assistance in\\n\\nthis sacrifice of mine, and conciliating them by sweet words and gifts, I\\n\\nshall represent unto them the business I have on hand, so that they may\\n\\naccomplish it.' Having said this, the monarch became silent. And, O\\n\\nchastiser of foes, when those priests well knew that they could not\\n\\nassist at the king's sacrifice, they pretended to be angry, and\\n\\naddressing that best of monarchs said, 'O best of kings, thy sacrifices\\n\\nare incessant!

O sinless one, from loss of judgment thou canst not\\n\\nwait (but urgest us repeatedly). Go unto Rudra! He will assist at thy\\n\\nsacrifice!' Hearing those words of censure and wrath, king Swetaki became\\n\\nangry. And the monarch wending to the mountains of Kailasa, devoted\\n\\nhimself to asceticism there. And, O king, the monarch began to worship\\n\\nMahadeva, with fixed attention, and by observing the most rigid vows. And\\n\\nforegoing all food at times, he passed a long period.

O Brahmana, the battle that took place\\n\\nof old between Arjuna--that foremost of smiters never defeated in\\n\\nbattle--and Bhava was highly extraordinary and without parallel. It\\n\\nmaketh one's hair stand on end to hear of it. Even the hearts of those\\n\\nlions among men--the brave sons of Pritha--trembled in consequence of\\n\\nwonder and joy and a sense of their own inferiority. O tell me in full\\n\\nwhat else Arjuna, did I do not see even the most trivial thing to Jishnu\\n\\nthat is censurable. Therefore, recite to me in full the history of that\\n\\nhero.\\\"\\n\\nVaisampayana said, \\\"O tiger among Kurus, I shall recite to thee that\\n\\nnarration, excellent and extensive and unrivalled, in connection with the\\n\\nillustrious hero. O sinless one, hear in detail the particulars about\\n\\nArjuna's meeting with the three-eyed god of gods, and his contact with\\n\\nthe illustrious god's person!\\n\\n\\\"At Yudhishthira's command, Dhananjaya of immeasurable prowess set out\\n\\n(from Kamyaka) to obtain a sight of Sakra, the chief of the celestials\\n\\nand of Sankara, the god of gods. And the strong-armed Arjuna of great\\n\\nmight set out armed with his celestial bow and a sword with golden hilt,\\n\\nfor the success of the object he had in view, northwards, towards the\\n\\nsummit of the Himavat. And, O king, that first of all warriors in the\\n\\nthree worlds, the son of Indra, with a calm mind, and firmly adhering to\\n\\nhis purpose, then devoted himself, without the loss of any time, to\\n\\nascetic austerities. And he entered, all alone, that terrible forest\\n\\nabounding with thorny plants and trees and flowers and fruits of various\\n\\nkinds, and inhabited by winged creatures of various species, and swarming\\n\\nwith animals of diverse kinds, and resorted to by Siddhas and Charanas.\\n\\nAnd when the son of Kunti entered that forest destitute of human beings,\\n\\nsounds of conchs and drums began to be heard in the heavens. And a thick\\n\\nshower of flowers fell upon the earth, and the clouds spreading over the\\n\\nfirmament caused a thick shade. Passing over those difficult and woody\\n\\nregions at the foot of the great mountains, Arjuna soon reached the\\n\\nbreast of the Himavat; and staying there for sometime began to shine in\\n\\nhis brilliancy. And he beheld there numerous trees with expanding\\n\\nverdure, resounding with the melodious notes of winged warblers. And he\\n\\nsaw there rivers with currents of the lapis lazuli, broken by the fierce\\n\\neddies here and there, and echoing with the notes of swans and ducks and\\n\\ncranes. And the banks of those rivers resounded with the mellifluous\\n\\nstrains of the male Kokilas and the notes of peacocks and cranes. And the\\n\\nmighty warrior, beholding those rivers of sacred and pure and delicious\\n\\nwater and their charming banks, became highly delighted. And the\\n\\ndelighted Arjuna of fierce energy and high soul then devoted himself to\\n\\nrigid austerities in that delightful and woody region. Clad in rags made\\n\\nof grass and furnished with a black deerskin and a stick, he commenced to\\n\\neat withered leaves fallen upon the ground. And he passed the first\"]}": {

All truthful men, O chief of Bharata's race,\\n\\nsucceed by their truthfulness in attaining to heaven and sporting there\\n\\nin felicity. Self-restraint is the attainment of the reward that attaches\\n\\nto Truth. I have discoursed on it with my whole heart. The man of humble\\n\\nheart who is possessed of self-restraint, without doubt, attains to great\\n\\nhonours in heaven. Listen now to me, O lord of Earth, as I expound to\\n\\nthee the merits of Brahmacharya. That man, who practises the vow of\\n\\nBrahmacharya from his birth to the time of his death, know, O king, has\\n\\nnothing unattainable! Many millions of Rishis are residing in the region\\n\\nof Brahma. All of them, while here, were devoted to Truth, and\\n\\nself-restrained and had their vital seed drawn up. The vow of\\n\\nBrahmacharya, O king, duly observed by a Brahmana, is sure to burn all\\n\\nhis sins. The Brahmana is said to be a blazing fire. In those Brahmanas\\n\\nthat are devoted to penances, the deity of fire becomes visible. If a\\n\\nBrahmacharin yields to wrath in consequence of any slight the chief of\\n\\nthe deities himself trembles in fear. Even this is the visible fruit of\\n\\nthe vow of Brahmacharya that is observed by the Rishis. Listen to me, O\\n\\nYudhishthira, what the merit is that attaches to the worship of the\\n\\nfather and the mother. He, who dutifully serves his father without ever\\n\\ncrossing him in anything, or similarly serves his mother or (elder)\\n\\nbrother or other senior or preceptor, it should be known, O king, earns a\\n\\nresidence in heaven. The man of cleansed soul, in consequence of such\\n\\nservice rendered to his seniors, has never even to behold hell.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXVI\\n\\n\\\"Yudhishthira said, 'I desire, O king, to hear thee discourse in detail\\n\\nupon those high ordinances which regulate gifts of kine, for it is by\\n\\nmaking gifts (of kine) according to those ordinances that one attains to\\n\\ninnumerable regions of eternal felicity.'\\n\\n\\\"Bhishma said, 'There is no gift, O lord of Earth, that is higher in\\n\\npoint of merit than the gift of kine. A cow, lawfully acquired, if given\\n\\naway, immediately rescues the whole race of the giver. That ritual which\\n\\nsprang for the benefit of the righteous, was subsequently declared for\\n\\nthe sake of all creatures. That ritual has come down from primeval time.\\n\\nIt existed even before it was declared. Verily, O king, listen to me as I\\n\\nrecite to thee that ritual which affects the gift of kine.[366] In days\"]}": {

And beholding his\\n\\nbrothers lying dead, the mighty armed son of Dharma with heart racked in\\n\\nanxiety, began to lament profusely, saying, 'Thou hadst, O mighty-armed\\n\\nVrikodara, vowed, saying,--I shall with mace smash the thighs of\\n\\nDuryodhana in battle! O enhancer of the glory of the Kurus, in thy death,\\n\\nO mighty-armed and high-souled one, all that hath become fruitless now!\\n\\nThe promises of men may be ineffectual; but why have the words of the\\n\\ngods uttered in respect of thee been thus fruitless? O Dhananjaya, while\\n\\nthou wert in thy mother's lying-in-room, the gods had said,--O Kunti,\\n\\nthis thy son shall not be inferior to him of a thousand eyes! And in the\\n\\nnorthern Paripatra mountains, all beings had sung, saying,--The\\n\\nprosperity (of this race), robbed by foes will be recovered by this one\\n\\nwithout delay. No one will be able to vanquish him in battle, while there\\n\\nwill be none whom he will not be able to vanquish. Why then hath that\\n\\nJishnu endued with great strength been subject to death? Oh, why doth\\n\\nthat Dhananjaya, relying on whom we had hitherto endured all this misery,\\n\\nlie on the ground blighting[108] all my hopes! Why have those heroes,\\n\\nthose mighty sons of Kunti, Bhimasena and Dhananjaya, came under the\\n\\npower of the enemy,--those who themselves always slew their foes, and\\n\\nwhom no weapons could resist! Surely, this vile heart of mine must be\\n\\nmade of adamant, since, beholding these twins lying today on the ground\\n\\nit doth not split! Ye bulls among men, versed in holy writ and acquainted\\n\\nwith the properties of time and place, and endued with ascetic merit, ye\\n\\nwho duly performed all sacred rites, why lie ye down, without performing\\n\\nacts deserving of you? Alas, why lie ye insensible on the earth, with\\n\\nyour bodies unwounded, ye unvanquished ones, and with your vows\\n\\nuntouched?' And beholding his brothers sweetly sleeping there as (they\\n\\nusually did) on mountain slopes, the high souled king, overwhelmed with\\n\\ngrief and bathed in sweat, came to a distressful condition. And\\n\\nsaying,--It is even so--that virtuous lord of men, immersed in an ocean\\n\\nof grief anxiously proceeded to ascertain the cause (of that\\n\\ncatastrophe). And that mighty-armed and high-souled one, acquainted with\\n\\nthe divisions of time and place, could not settle his course of action.\\n\\nHaving thus bewailed much in this strain, the virtuous Yudhishthira, the\\n\\nson of Dharma or Tapu, restrained his soul and began to reflect in his\\n\\nmind as to who had slain those heroes. 'There are no strokes of weapons\\n\\nupon these, nor is any one's foot-print here. The being must be mighty I\\n\\nween, by whom my brothers have been slain.

What man of sense\\n\\ncan trust wicked wight of evil passions with whom good and evil are\\n\\nalike? Or, perhaps, this may be an act of that wicked-souled one through\\n\\nsecret messengers of his.' And it was thus that that highly intelligent\\n\\none gave way to diverse reflections.

If words alone could lead\\n\\nto success, then with thee, O son of Radha, as his protector, this bull\\n\\namong the Kurus would be considered to have the amplest measure of\\n\\nprotection. Thou boastest much, O Karna, in the presence of the Kuru\\n\\nchief, but thy prowess is seldom witnessed, nor, indeed, any result (of\\n\\nthy boastful speeches). Many a time have we seen thee encounter the sons\\n\\nof Pandu in battle. On every one of those occasions, O Suta's son, thou\\n\\nhast been vanquished by the Pandavas. While Dhritarashtra's son was being\\n\\ntaken away (as a captive) by the Gandharvas, all the troops fought on\\n\\nthat occasion except thy single self, who was the first to fly away. In\\n\\nVirata's city also, all the Kauravas, united together, including thyself\\n\\nand thy younger brother were vanquished by Partha in battle. Thou art not\\n\\na match for even one of the sons of Pandu, viz., Phalguna, on the field\\n\\nof battle. How then canst thou venture to vanquish all the sons of Pandu\\n\\nwith Krishna at their head? Thou indulgest in too much brag, O Suta's\\n\\nson! Engage thyself in battle without saying anything. To Put forth\\n\\nprowess without indulging in brag is the duty of good men. Ever roaring\\n\\naloud, O Suta's son like the dry clouds of autumn, thou showest thyself,\\n\\nO Karna to be without substance. The king, however, does not understand\\n\\nit. Thou roarest, O son of Radha, as long as thou seest not the son of\\n\\nPritha. These thy roars disappear when thou seest Partha near. Indeed,\\n\\nthou roarest as long as thou art out of the range of Phalguna's shafts.\\n\\nThose roars of thine disappear when thou art pierced with Partha's\\n\\nshafts. Kshatriyas evince their eminence by means of their arms;\\n\\nBrahmanas, by means of speech; Arjuna evinces his by means of the bow;\\n\\nbut Karna, by the castles he builds in the air. Who is there that will\\n\\nresist that Partha who gratified Rudra himself (in battle)?' Thus railed\\n\\nat by Saradwat's son, Karna, that foremost of smiters, answered Kripa in\\n\\nthe following strain, 'Heroes always roar like clouds in the season of\\n\\nrains, and like steeds put in the soil, quickly yield fruits. I do not\\n\\nsee any fault in heroes that take great burdens on their shoulders,\\n\\nindulging in boastful speeches on the field of battle. When a person\\n\\nmentally resolves to bear a burden, Destiny itself aids him in the\\n\\nexecution. Wishing in my heart bear a great burden, I always summon\\n\\nsufficient resolution. If, slaying the sons of Pandu with Krishna and\\n\\nSatwatas in battle, I indulge in such roars, what is it to thee, O\\n\\nBrahmana? They that are heroes never roar fruitlessly like autumnal\\n\\nclouds. Conscious of their own might, the wise indulge in roars! In my\\n\\nheart I am determined to vanquish in battle today Krishna and Partha\\n\\nunited together and fighting with resolution! It is for this that I roar,\\n\\nO son of Gotama! Behold the fruit of these my roars, O Brahmana! Slaying\\n\\nthe son of Pandu in battle, with all their followers, Krishna and\\n\\nSatwatas, I will bestow on Duryodhana the whole earth without a thorn in\\n\\nit.'\\n\\n\\\"Kripa said, 'Little do I reckon, O Suta's son, these delirious saying of\\n\\nthine discovering thy thoughts, not deeds. Thou always speakest in\\n\\ndepreciation of the two Krishnas and king Yudhishthira the just. He, O\\n\\nKarna, is certain, to have the victory who hath on his side those two\\n\\nheroes skilled in battle. Indeed, Krishna and Arjuna are incapable of\\n\\nbeing defeated by the celestials, the Gandharvas, the Yakshas, human\\n\\nbeings, the Nagas, and the birds, all clad in mail.

Her participation in decision-making, particularly in the war, helps the Pandavas win. Her honor and dignity are also a significant theme, as her dishonoring by the Kauravas sparks the war. Draupadi's character represents the importance of women's empowerment and the need for their involvement in decision-making processes.\\n\\n2. **Kunti**: As the mother of the Pandavas, Kunti is portrayed as a strong and wise figure. She is the supreme authority in the Pandava household and is obeyed by her sons. Kunti's guidance and advice play a significant role in the Pandavas' success, particularly in their dealings with Krishna and other mentors. Her character reflects the importance of maternal influence and the role of women in shaping the lives of their children.\\n\\n3. **Gandhari**: Although Gandhari is not a major character in the provided context, her role in the epic is significant.

At that time Pandavas actions were very qualitative due to able guidance of Krishna which lead Pandavas towards success. 3.12 Right Mentoring In every difficult task, one has to seek advise of mentors. It is always advisable to choose a right person for this purpose who can show you the right path. The success of Pandavas was due to the guidance and continuous touch as well as support of Krishna, Bhishma, Vidura and other such dignitaries. Good managers must guide their subordinates effectively for growth of their organizations. 3.13 Understanding and Analyzing situations Features of good management are to perceive and deeply analyze the situation from small gestures. Duryodhna planned to kill all the Pandavas in Lakshagraha, but Vidura as their well wisher secretary conveyed the message to them. It was the intelligence of Pandavas who were able to understand his indirect message for them. Hence, they could save their lives. Promoters and management of a firm should know the market situations, perceptions of the consumers, investors etc but on the other hand Pandavas paid due regard to their values and truthfulness. This was the cause of their success mantra. Similarly, all management practices must be started with ethics. Initially, we may be in difficult situation but in long run we will be rewarded. Good ethical practices in a business can attract all the stakeholders. We can gain more goodwill, large number of customers, suppliers and high profitability. Institutes like Infosys are known for their trust and moral values. 3.14 Practice Arjuna has perfection in his work due to practice and experience. Karana also possessed the art of targeting arrow perfectly due to his continuous practice. They focused on their goals. It was regular practice, dedication and commitment of Arjuna which made him powerful during war and he defeated great warriors of Kauravas. After the loss of their kingdom, Pandavas tried to work on their weaknesses and learned new skills. Arjuna utilized the time during their exile to acquire new weapons. Yudhishthra acquired teachings from various Rishis and learned the game of dice. Business promoters must experience their products and plans in order to survive in long run. They need to concentrate on continuous improvement for the success of business. 3.15 Women empowerment Women empowerment means participation of women in decision making. Participation of women in decision making helps to view the situation in holistic way. Harmonious, feminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded according to his contribution. This will encourage team members to work harder. Yudhishtra was asked by Yaksha to choose the life of one of his brothers. He had chosen Nakul at that time because his two brothers Bhima and Arjun were born to Kunti and other two Nakula and Sahadeva to his father\\u2019s second wife Madri. Since he is alive Kunti is partially bereaved. Life of Nakula would partially bereaved the Madri at that time. Yaksha was impressed with the impartial decision of Yudhishthra and\"]}": {

King Swetaki, a celebrated monarch, performed numerous sacrifices and charitable acts, earning him a reputation as a just and intelligent ruler. He was assisted by his Ritwiks (sacrificial priests) in these rituals.\\n2. However, after many years of performing sacrifices, the Ritwiks became weak and afflicted by the smoke, leading them to leave King Swetaki's service.\\n3. Despite their departure, King Swetaki repeatedly invited new priests to assist him in his sacrifices, but they also refused, citing their own exhaustion from previous labors.\\n4. Frustrated and determined, King Swetaki turned to Mahadeva (Shiva), the chief of the celestials, and devoted himself to asceticism, worshiping Mahadeva with fixed attention and observing rigid vows.\\n5. King Swetaki's ascetic practices became so intense that he began to eat only fruits and roots at specific times of the day (twelfth and sixteenth hours).\\n6. The Ritwiks, who had grown tired of King Swetaki's persistence, advised him to seek assistance from Rudra (Shiva), the god of destruction, to complete his sacrifice.\\n7.

When Agni consumed in wrath the\\n\\nforest of Khandava, it is evident there was a grave cause. I desire, O\\n\\nBrahmana, to hear all this in detail from thee. Tell me, O sage, how the\\n\\nKhandava forest was consumed in days of yore.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'O chief of men, I will narrate to you the story of\\n\\nthe conflagration of Khandava as told by Rishis in the Purana. It hath\\n\\nbeen heard, O king, in the Purana that there was a celebrated king of the\\n\\nname of Swetaki who was endued with strength and prowess and who was\\n\\nequal unto Indra himself. No one on earth has equalled him in sacrifices,\\n\\ncharity, and intelligence. Swetaki performed the five great sacrifices\\n\\nand many others, at all of which the presents unto Brahmanas were large.\\n\\nThe heart of that monarch, O king, was always set upon sacrifices,\\n\\nreligious rites, and gifts of all kinds. And king Swetaki of great\\n\\nintelligence, assisted by his Ritwiks performed sacrifices for many long\\n\\nyears, till those sacrificial priests with eyes afflicted by the\\n\\ncontinued smoke and becoming very weak, left that monarch, wishing never\\n\\nmore to assist at his sacrifices. The king, however, repeatedly asked\\n\\nthose Ritwiks to come to him. But they came not to his sacrifice in\\n\\nconsequence of the painful state of their eyes. The king, therefore,\\n\\ninvited at the command of his own Ritwiks, others like unto them, and\\n\\ncompleted the sacrifice that he had begun. After some days had elapsed,\\n\\nking Swetaki desired to perform another sacrifice which should extend for\\n\\na hundred years. But the illustrious monarch obtained not any priest to\\n\\nassist him in it. The celebrated king then, with his friends and\\n\\nrelatives, casting off all sloth, repeatedly courted his priests with\\n\\ngreat persistence, by bowing down unto them, by conciliatory speeches,\\n\\nand by gifts of wealth. All of them, however, refused to accomplish the\\n\\npurpose which that king of immeasurable energy had in view. Then that\\n\\nroyal sage, getting angry, addressed those Brahmanas sitting in their\\n\\nasylums, and said, 'If, ye Brahmanas, I were a fallen person, or, if, I\\n\\nwere wanting in homage and service to you, I should then deserve to be\\n\\nabandoned without scruple by you and by other Brahmanas at the same time.\\n\\nBut as I am neither degraded nor wanting in homage to you, it behoveth\\n\\nyou not to obstruct the performance by me of my sacrifice or to abandon\\n\\nme thus, ye foremost of Brahmanas, without adequate reason. I seek, ye\\n\\nBrahmanas, your protection! It behoveth you to be propitious unto me.\\n\\nBut, ye foremost of Brahmanas, if you abandon me from enmity alone or any\\n\\nimproper motive, I shall go unto other priests for their assistance in\\n\\nthis sacrifice of mine, and conciliating them by sweet words and gifts, I\\n\\nshall represent unto them the business I have on hand, so that they may\\n\\naccomplish it.' Having said this, the monarch became silent. And, O\\n\\nchastiser of foes, when those priests well knew that they could not\\n\\nassist at the king's sacrifice, they pretended to be angry, and\\n\\naddressing that best of monarchs said, 'O best of kings, thy sacrifices\\n\\nare incessant! By assisting thee always, we have all been fatigued. And\\n\\nas we have been wearied in consequence of these labours, it behoveth thee\\n\\nto give us leave. O sinless one, from loss of judgment thou canst not\\n\\nwait (but urgest us repeatedly). Go unto Rudra! He will assist at thy\\n\\nsacrifice!' Hearing those words of censure and wrath, king Swetaki became\\n\\nangry. And the monarch wending to the mountains of Kailasa, devoted\\n\\nhimself to asceticism there. And, O king, the monarch began to worship\\n\\nMahadeva, with fixed attention, and by observing the most rigid vows. And\\n\\nforegoing all food at times, he passed a long period. The monarch ate\\n\\nonly fruits and roots sometimes at the twelfth and sometimes at the\\n\\nsixteenth hour of the whole day. King Swetaki stood for six months, rapt\"]}": {
