He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\"]}": {

        "{\"actual_output\": \"Karna and Arjuna, two of the most prominent characters in the Mahabharata, represent contrasting paths and embody key themes of the epic. While both are exceptional warriors, their journeys diverge significantly, highlighting the complexities of duty, friendship, and destiny.\\n\\n**Similarities:**\\n\\n* **Exceptional Skill:** Both Karna and Arjuna are renowned for their unparalleled archery skills. They are considered the greatest warriors of their time, capable of feats that defy ordinary human limits.\\n* **Courage and Valor:** Both display immense courage and unwavering determination in battle. They face their opponents fearlessly, even when the odds are stacked against them.\\n* **Loyalty:** Both are fiercely loyal to their respective sides. Karna remains steadfast in his allegiance to Duryodhana, despite knowing the Kauravas' cause is unjust. Arjuna, on the other hand, is devoted to the Pandavas and their righteous cause.\\n* **Tragic Fates:** Both characters experience profound tragedy. Karna, despite his noble qualities, is ultimately defeated and killed by Arjuna, fulfilling a prophecy that binds him to his destiny. Arjuna, though victorious, is burdened by the consequences of war and the loss of loved ones.\\n\\n**Differences:**\\n\\n* **Upbringing and Social Status:** Arjuna is born into the royal family of the Pandavas, enjoying privilege and a supportive environment. Karna, despite being the son of Kunti and Surya, is raised as a charioteer's son, facing social ostracism and prejudice.\\n* **Moral Compass:** While both are skilled warriors, Arjuna ultimately fights for righteousness and justice, guided by his conscience and the teachings of Krishna. Karna, though possessing noble qualities, is blinded by his loyalty to Duryodhana and his desire for recognition, leading him down a path of moral ambiguity.\\n* **Choices and Actions:** Arjuna, despite his initial hesitation, ultimately chooses to fight for what is right, even when it means confronting his own kin. Karna, bound by his oath to Duryodhana, remains loyal even when faced with the Kauravas' treachery and the suffering it causes.\\n\\n**Contribution to Themes:**\\n\\nThe parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna illuminate several key themes of the Mahabharata:\\n\\n* **The Nature of Dharma:** Both characters grapple with the concept of dharma, but their interpretations diverge. Arjuna's adherence to righteous duty ultimately leads him to victory, while Karna's misguided loyalty to Duryodhana results in his downfall.\\n* **The Power of Choice:** Despite their shared destiny, Karna and Arjuna make different choices that shape their lives and destinies. Arjuna's willingness to question and ultimately choose the path of righteousness contrasts with Karna's unwavering loyalty, even when it leads to moral compromise.\\n* **The Complexity of Human Nature:** Both characters embody the complexities of human nature. They possess both noble qualities and flaws, highlighting the internal struggles and moral dilemmas that individuals face.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Karna and Arjuna, though seemingly opposites, are intricately woven into the fabric of the Mahabharata. Their contrasting journeys serve as a powerful exploration of dharma, choice, and the multifaceted nature of human experience. Their parallel narratives elevate the epic beyond a simple battle narrative, transforming it into a profound reflection on the human condition.\\n\\n\\n\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Compare and contrast the characters of Karna and Arjuna, analyzing their similarities, differences, and how their parallel journeys contribute to the epic's themes.\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"against Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most.

This demonstrates the paramount importance of duty and upholding one's word in the epic. \\n* **Self-Sacrifice:** His decision to remain celibate is a profound act of self-sacrifice. He willingly renounces a fundamental human desire for the sake of his father's happiness and his own vow.\\n* **Unforeseen Consequences:**  However, Bhishma's unwavering adherence to duty leads to unforeseen and tragic consequences. The kingdom is left without an heir, and his vow ultimately contributes to the conflict and bloodshed that defines the Mahabharata.\\n\\nThis paradox highlights the complexities of duty. While Bhishma's actions are driven by a noble intention, they ultimately contribute to the very problems he seeks to avoid. The Mahabharata doesn't offer easy answers, but rather explores the difficult choices individuals face when duty and personal desire clash. \\n\\n\\nBhishma's story serves as a cautionary tale, reminding us that even the most well-intentioned actions can have unintended and devastating consequences. \\n\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"Lessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life.

Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nthat belongs to him. Bhima, however, of mighty arms, recollecting all his\\n\\ninnumerable sorrows, has with difficulty given his consent, breathing\\n\\nmany heavy sighs. That mighty-armed hero, O monarch, was solicited by the\\n\\nrighteous king as also by Vibhatsu, and induced to assume relations of\\n\\ncordiality towards thee. King Yudhishthira the just, his prayed thee not\\n\\nto give way to dissatisfaction for the improper conduct which Bhima has\\n\\ndisplayed at the recollection of former hostilities. This is generally\\n\\nthe behaviour of Kshatriyas in battle, O king, and this Vrikodara is\\n\\ndevoted to battle and the practices of Kshatriyas.

It's a force that governs the universe, bringing about both creation and destruction, rise and fall, and ultimately, the cycle of life and death. \\n\\nHere's an analysis of how Kala is portrayed as both a destroyer and preserver, using examples from different parvas:\\n\\n**Destroyer:**\\n\\n* **Mausala Parva:** The passage you provided vividly illustrates Kala's destructive power. The massacre of the Vrishni heroes at Prabhasa is attributed to Kala, highlighting its role in bringing about inevitable destruction, even to the mightiest. The line \\\"Behold the perverse course of Time\\\" emphasizes the unpredictable and often cruel nature of Kala's workings.\\n* **Bhisma Parva:** The death of Bhisma, despite his immense strength and piety, is a testament to Kala's power. Even the most righteous and powerful are subject to its inexorable flow. Bhisma himself acknowledges this, stating that \\\"Time is the greatest destroyer.\\\"\\n* **Virata Parva:** The exile of the Pandavas, a period of hardship and suffering, is also influenced by Kala. Their forced separation from their kingdom and loved ones is a consequence of the passage of time and the unfolding of destiny.\\n\\n**Preserver:**\\n\\n* **Adi Parva:** The creation of the universe itself is attributed to Kala. The opening verses of the Mahabharata describe Kala as the seed of the universe, highlighting its role in bringing about existence.\\n* **Drona Parva:** The Kurukshetra War, while a devastating event, is also seen as a necessary act of Kala. It brings about the end of an era and paves the way for a new order.\\n* **Shanti Parva:** The post-war period, marked by peace and reconciliation, is a testament to Kala's ability to bring about renewal and restoration. The emphasis on dharma and righteousness in this parva suggests that Kala ultimately works towards the preservation of cosmic order.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe Mahabharata presents a nuanced view of Time, recognizing its dual nature as both destroyer and preserver. It is a force that governs the universe, bringing about both creation and destruction, rise and fall, and ultimately, the cycle of life and death. While Kala's destructive power is undeniable, it is also a force that brings about renewal and restoration. The epic encourages us to accept the inevitability of Time's passage and to strive for righteousness in the face of its ever-changing currents.\\n\\n\\n\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Analyze how the concept of Time (Kala) is portrayed as both a destroyer and preserver throughout the epic, using specific examples from different parvas?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"also, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished.

Despite Arjuna having previously helped him by burning the forest of Khandava, Agni held a grudge against him for a perceived slight.\\n* **Agni's challenge:**  Agni, in his embodied form, challenged Arjuna to a contest, demanding that he cast off his celestial bow Gandiva before entering the forest.

It solidified their reputation as skilled warriors and earned them the favor of powerful deities.\\n* **Increased tension with the Kauravas:** The Pandavas' growing power and influence further fueled the rivalry with the Kauravas, ultimately leading to the epic war of Mahabharata.\\n* **Symbolic significance:** The burning of the Khandava Forest symbolizes the destructive power of ambition and the importance of balance between power and righteousness.\\n\\n\\nThe event serves as a reminder of the complex interplay between divine forces, human ambition, and the consequences of actions.\\n\\n\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Describe the events leading up to and including the burning of the Khandava Forest.

The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon.

She is not merely a passive wife but an active participant in the Pandavas' lives, influencing their decisions and offering unwavering support. Her role in binding the Pandavas together for 14 years in exile highlights her strength and strategic thinking. The humiliation she endures at the hands of the Kauravas, particularly during the dice game, serves as a catalyst for the war, demonstrating the consequences of disrespecting women and their agency. Draupadi's story challenges patriarchal norms and emphasizes the importance of justice and dignity for women.\\n\\n**Kunti:** As the mother of the Pandavas, Kunti embodies a matriarchal influence. She is the ultimate decision-maker in the Pandava camp, respected and obeyed by her sons. Her wisdom and guidance are crucial to their survival and success. Kunti's actions, such as arranging for Karna's birth and later revealing his true identity, demonstrate her complex moral compass and her willingness to make difficult choices for the greater good. Her character highlights the power of maternal love and the importance of female leadership.\\n\\n**Gandhari:** Gandhari, the wife of Dhritarashtra, represents a different kind of female power. Bound by her vow to remain blindfolded, she embodies a sense of sacrifice and unwavering loyalty to her husband and sons. While she is often ignored and her counsel disregarded, her presence serves as a reminder of the consequences of blind ambition and the destructive nature of patriarchal structures.

The epic demonstrates that women can be powerful agents of change, shaping the course of events through their actions, choices, and unwavering loyalty. \\n\\nHowever, it also highlights the limitations imposed on women by societal norms and the dangers of unchecked male ambition.

Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nrisen from sleep. Kunti also shall behold Karna, and she of Yadu's race\\n\\nshall behold her son Abhimanyu. Draupadi shall behold her five sons, her\\n\\nsires, and her brothers also. Even before ye had asked me, this was the\\n\\nthought in my mind. I entertained this purpose when I was urged to that\\n\\neffect by the king, by thee, O Gandhari, and by Kunti. Thou shouldst not\\n\\ngrieve for those foremost of men. They met with death in consequence of\\n\\ntheir devotion to the established practices of Kshatriyas. O faultless\\n\\none, the work of the gods could not but be accomplished. It was for\\n\\naccomplishing that object that those heroes came down on Earth. They were\\n\\nall portions of the deities. Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Pisachas and\\n\\nGuhyakas and Rakshasas, many persons of great sanctity, many individuals\\n\\nwere checked in battle,--heroes that were equal to Indra himself in\\n\\nmight--why would not he ascend to Heaven? O irresistible one, do thou\\n\\nkill this grief of thine. Do not suffer thyself to be swayed by wrath.\\n\\nThat conqueror of hostile cities has attained in that sanctified goal\\n\\nwhich depends upon death at the edge of weapons. After the fall of that\\n\\nhero, this my sister Subhadra stricken with grief, indulged in loud\\n\\nlamentations, when she saw Kunti, like a female ospray. When she met\\n\\nDraupadi, she asked her in grief,--O reverend lady, where are all our\\n\\nsons? I desire to behold them. Hearing her lamentations, all the Kaurava\\n\\nladies embraced her and wept sitting around her. Beholding (her\\n\\ndaughter-in-law) Uttara, she said,--'O blessed girl, where has thy\\n\\nhusband gone? When he comes back, do thou, without losing a moment,\\n\\napprise me of it. Alas, O daughter of Virata, as soon he heard my voice,\\n\\nhe used to come out of his chamber without the loss of a moment. Why does\"]}": {

        "{\"actual_output\": \"Bhishma's vow of celibacy, taken to ensure his father's happiness, perfectly encapsulates the central conflict of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata. \\n\\nHere's how:\\n\\n* **Duty:** Bhishma's vow was a profound act of duty towards his father, Satyavati. He prioritized his father's happiness and the stability of the Kuru dynasty above his own personal desires for marriage and family. This act of self-sacrifice exemplifies the paramount importance of duty in the Mahabharata.\\n\\n* **Personal Desire:**  While Bhishma fulfilled his duty, his vow also tragically denied him the fulfillment of his personal desire for a family and a life with a partner. This sacrifice highlights the inherent tension between fulfilling one's obligations and pursuing personal happiness.\\n\\n* **Consequences:** Bhishma's vow, while initially motivated by love and duty, ultimately had far-reaching and devastating consequences. It led to the birth of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, who were destined to clash in a devastating war. This demonstrates the complex and often unforeseen consequences of prioritizing duty over personal desire.\\n\\nThe Mahabharata constantly grapples with this theme.  Bhishma's story serves as a cautionary tale, showing that even the noblest of intentions can have unintended and tragic outcomes when duty and personal desire are in conflict. It raises questions about the nature of sacrifice, the limits of duty, and the ultimate price of upholding one's obligations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"of the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself.

Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nthat belongs to him. Bhima, however, of mighty arms, recollecting all his\\n\\ninnumerable sorrows, has with difficulty given his consent, breathing\\n\\nmany heavy sighs. That mighty-armed hero, O monarch, was solicited by the\\n\\nrighteous king as also by Vibhatsu, and induced to assume relations of\\n\\ncordiality towards thee. King Yudhishthira the just, his prayed thee not\\n\\nto give way to dissatisfaction for the improper conduct which Bhima has\\n\\ndisplayed at the recollection of former hostilities. This is generally\\n\\nthe behaviour of Kshatriyas in battle, O king, and this Vrikodara is\\n\\ndevoted to battle and the practices of Kshatriyas. Both myself and\\n\\nArjuna, O king, repeatedly beg thee for pardoning Vrikodara. Be gracious\\n\\nunto us. Thou art our lord. Whatever wealth we have, thou mayst give away\\n\\nas thou likest, O ruler of Earth. Thou, O Bharata. art the Master of this\\n\\nkingdom and of all lives in it. Let the foremost one of Kuru's race give\\n\\ncomes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context. If you do not change your decision making instinct with the context, prepare for a storm, prepare for the \\u201cMahabharata\\u201d.\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\\n\\nYudhishthira and the father of Duryodhana. When the Kuru king recollected\\n\\nhis wicked son, he then could not but feel unfriendly, in his heart,\\n\\ntowards Bhima. Bhimasena also, O king, impelled by a heart that seemed to\\n\\nbe wicked, was unable to put up with king Dhritarashtra. Vrikodara\\n\\nsecretly did many acts that were disagreeable to the old king. Through\\n\\ndeceitful servitors he caused the commands of his uncle to be disobeyed.\\n\\nRecollecting the evil counsels of the old king and some acts of his,\\n\\nBhima, one day, in the midst of his friends, slapped his armpits, in the\\n\\nhearing of Dhritarashtra and of Gandhari. The wrathful Vrikodara,\\n\\nrecollecting his foes Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana, gave way to a\\n\\ntransport of passion, and said these harsh words: 'The sons of the blind\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\\n\\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\\n\\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\\n\\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,\\n\\npractised penances. I have no fear of death.'\\n\\n\\\"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's\\n\\noffspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,\\n\\nagain, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by\\n\\nthy own self (in the form of thy son).'\\n\\n\\\"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in\\n\\nself-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various\\n\\noccasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nhe can never marry because of his vow of Brahmacharya. To this Amba pledges \\u201cI will be the reason of your death, no matter how many times I have to take birth. I know you cannot be killed because of your vardaan of Ichyamrityu but I will take birth time and time again and will be the reason of your death.\\u201d So what do we have here? An impossible situation of killing Bheesma by a woman who does not know how to hold a bow. This woman, however is determined to kill Bheesma. Her determination is as strong as a rock and she did become the reason of Bheesma\\u2019s death on the 10th day of Kurukhshetra battle. She was reborn as Shikhandi \\u2013 half woman/half man. Bheesma would never fire a weapon towards a woman and Arjuna utilized this weakness (Achilees heel of Bheesma) Inference: Work hard and you will succeed and overcome any situation, no matter how difficult it is. Focus on the entire thing, listen carefully before you act \\u2013 Drona In the battle of Kurukshetra, Drona is an unstoppable warrior.\\n\\nlike a skeleton covered with skin, Dharma's son Yudhishthira shed tears\\n\\nof grief and once more said these words. 'O foremost of men, I do not\\n\\ndesire life and the Earth. O scorcher of foes, I shall employ myself in\\n\\ndoing what is agreeable to thee. If I deserve thy favour, if I am dear to\\n\\nthee, do thou eat something. I shall then know what to do.' Endued with\\n\\ngreat energy, Dhritarashtra then said to Yudhishthira,--'I wish, O son,\\n\\nto take some food, with thy permission.' When Dhritarashtra said these\\n\\nwords to Yudhishthira, Satyavati's son Vyasa came there and said as\\n\\nfollows.`\\n\\nSECTION IV\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, do without any scruple what\\n\\nDhritarashtra of Kuru's race hag said. This king is old. He has, again,\\n\\nbeen made sonless. I think he will not be able to bear his grief long.\\n\\nThe highly blessed Gandhari, possessed of great wisdom and endued with\\n\\nkindly speech, bears with fortitude her excessive grief owing to the logs\\n\\ntherefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley. My body,\\n\\nlife-breaths, and religious rites have all one purpose viz., the service\\n\\nof my senior. Through thy grace, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain many\\n\\nregions of happiness hereafter. I deserve to be looked after by thee.\\n\\nKnow, O regenerate one, that I am wholly devoted to thee. Cherishing also\\n\\nthis thought, viz., that my happiness is thy concern, it behoveth thee to\\n\\ntake this my share of the barley.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O chaste lady, in consequence of such conduct\\n\\nof thine thou wilt for ever shine in glory, for endued with vows and\\n\\nsteadiness in religious rites, thy eyes are directed to that conduct\\n\\nwhich should be observed towards seniors. Therefore, O daughter-in-law, I\\n\\nshall take thy share of the barley. Thou deservest not to be deceived by\\n\\nme, reckoning all thy virtues. Thou art truly, O blessed damsel, the\\n\\nforemost of all persons observing the duties of righteousness.' Having\\n\\nappeased. Beholding him ungratified, the Brahmana in the observance of\\n\\nthe Unccha vow became thoughtful. His son then said unto him, 'O best of\\n\\nmen, taking my share of the barely do thou give it to the guest. I regard\\n\\nthis act of mine as one of great merit. Therefore, do it. Thou shouldst\\n\\nbe always maintained by me with great care. Maintenance of the father is\\n\\na duty which the good always covet. The maintenance of the father in his\\n\\nold age is the duty ordained for the son. Even this is the eternal sruti\\n\\n(audition) current in the three worlds, O learned Rishi. By barely living\\n\\nthou art capable of practising penances. The life-breath is the great\\n\\ndeity that resides in the bodies of all embodied creatures.'[217]\\n\\n\\\"The father, at this, said, 'If thou attainest to the age of even a\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\nservices which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\\n\\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\\n\\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\\n\\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\\n\\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\\n\\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\\n\\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\\n\\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\\n\\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\\n\\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\\n\\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\\n\\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\\n\\nSudras of his realm. Whatever wrongs were done to him by the sons of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, king Yudhishthira, forgot them all, and reverenced his\\n\\nuncle. If any man did anything that was not agreeable to the son of\\n\\nAmvika, he became thereby an object of hatred to the intelligent son of\\n\\nKunti. Indeed, through fear of Yudhishthira, nobody could talk of the\\n\\nevil deeds of either Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra. Both Gandhari and\\n\\nVidura also wore well pleased with the capacity the king Ajatasatru\\n\\nshowed for bearing wrongs. They were, however, not so pleased, O slayer\\n\\nof foes, with Bhima. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, was truly obedient to\\n\\nhis uncle. Bhima, however, at the sight of Dhritarashtra, became very\\n\\ncheerless. That slayer of foes, seeing Dharma's son reverencing the old\\n\\nking, reverenced him outwardly with a very unwilling heart.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. Empathy\"]}": {

The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava force\\n\\nviz., the Pandavas of wide chests. They said, 'We wish to know who\\n\\namongst these is Yudhishthira, who are Bhima and Arjuna, who the twins,\\n\\nand who is Draupadi of great fame.'

Summoning next the heroic\\n\\nking Vabhruvahana, Yudhishthira gave unto him diverse kinds of wealth in\\n\\nprofusion and gave him permission to return home. The son of Pandu, for\\n\\ngratifying his sister Dussala, established her infant grandson in his\\n\\npaternal kingdom. The Kuru king Yudhishthira, having a full control over\\n\\nhis senses, then dismissed the assembled kings all of whom had been\\n\\nproperly classed and honoured by him.[212] The illustrious son of Pandu,\\n\\n\\\"Then Yudhishthira once more summoned all his subjects. The royal sage informed them of his intentions. The citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, hearing the kings words, became filled with anxiety and disapproved of them. This should never be done, said they unto the king. The monarch, well versed with the changes brought about by time, did not listen to their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the people to sanction his views. He then set his heart on leaving the world. His brothers also formed the same resolution. Then Dharmas son, Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, casting off his ornaments, wore barks of trees. Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, and Draupadi also of great fame, similarly clad themselves in bark of trees, O king. Having caused the preliminary rites of religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost of men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding the\\n\\nYudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.--Do thou command, O\\n\\nmonarch, what gifts should be made to these.

Surrounded by the deities, the Kuru king Yudhishthira then proceeded from that spot. He was accompanied by Dharma, and the great Rishis uttered his praises. Indeed, he reached that place where those foremost of men, those heroes, viz., the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, freed from (human) wrath, were enjoying each his respective status.\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n4\\n\\nonce more addressed Vidura and said, 'It behoves not king Dhritarashtra\\n\\nto be angry with Bhimasena.

Do thou, however,\\n\\ninstructed by me, say unto the king, O foremost one of Bharata's race,\\n\\nthat he may take from my house whatever articles he wishes and in\\n\\nwhatever measure also he likes. Thou shalt also tell the king that he\\n\\nshould not allow his heart to dwell on this exhibition of pride in which\\n\\nBhima, deeply afflicted, has indulged. Whatever wealth I have and\\n\\nwhatever Arjuna has in his house, the owner thereof is king\\n\\nDhritarashtra. Even this thou shouldst tell him. Let the king make gifts\\n\\nunto the Brahmanas.

So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons.

The high-souled Karna, the son of Kunti, incapable of being baffled in battle, Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, the sons of Dhrishtadyumna and those other Kshatriyas who met with death in the observance of Kshatriya practices, where are those lords of Earth, O Brahmana?

Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nI beheld before the carnage of those Kshatriyas who were the foremost\\n\\nones of Kurus race. It is impossible for me to see this city of the\\n\\nYadavas without the Yadus beside me. Know that proceeding to the woods I\\n\\nshall practise penances with Rama in my company. Having said these words,\\n\\nKrishna touched the feet of his father with his head, and quickly left\\n\\nhis presence. Then a loud wail of sorrow arose from the ladies and\\n\\nchildren of his house. Hearing that loud sound of wailing uttered by the\\n\\nweeping ladies, Keshava retraced his foot-steps and said unto them,\\n\\nArjuna will come here. That foremost of man will relieve you of your\\n\\ngrief.\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding then to the forest, Keshava beheld Rama sitting in a solitary\\n\\nspot thereof. He also saw that Rama had set himself to Yoga and that from\\n\\nout his mouth was issuing a mighty snake. The colour of that snake was\\n\\nwhite. Leaving the human body (in which he had dwelt so long), that\\n\\nI am seeking to expiate my sins. Now at the fourth division of the day or\\n\\nsometimes at the eighth division, with the regularity of a vow, I eat a\\n\\nlittle food for simply conquering my thirst. Gandhari knows this. All my\\n\\nattendants are under the impression that I eat as usual. Through fear of\\n\\nYudhishthira alone I concealed my acts, for if the eldest son of Pandu\\n\\ncame to know of my vow, he would feel great pain. Clad in deer-skin, I\\n\\nlie down on the Earth, spreading a small quantity of Kusa grass, and pass\\n\\nthe time in silent recitations. Gandhari of great fame passes her time in\\n\\nthe observance of similar vows. Even thus do we both behave, we that have\\n\\nlost a century of gong none of whom even retreated from battle. I do not,\\n\\nhowever, grieve for those children of mine. They have all died in the\\n\\nobservance of Kshatriya duties.' Having said these words, the old king\\n\\nthen addressed Yudhishthira in particular and said, 'Blessed be thou, O\\n\\nuniverse.

Verily, destiny is not capable of being resisted by human\\n\\nexertion. Eight and ten Akshauhinis of troops, O monarch, were brought\\n\\ntogether. In eight and ten days that host was destroyed by the foremost\\n\\nof Kuru warriors, viz., Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and others, and the\\n\\nhigh-souled Karna, and the heroic Yuyudhana, and Dhrishtadyumna, and by\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\npleased, at the command of Dhritarashtra. He beheld many sacrificial\\n\\naltars with sacred fires blazing on them and with many ascetics seated on\\n\\nthem, that had performed their oblations and poured libations in honour\\n\\nof the deities. Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the\\n\\nforest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled\\n\\nupwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics\\n\\npossessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many\\n\\nthat belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or\\n\\nresting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also\\n\\nwere there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole\\n\\nforest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and\\n\\nKokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with\\n\\nthe chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas. Some were adorned\\n\\nYudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.--Do thou command, O\\n\\nmonarch, what gifts should be made to these. All things are ready\\n\\nhere.--As soon as the king spoke, they gave away what he directed.[30]\\n\\nUnto him that was to receive a hundred, a thousand was given, and unto\\n\\nhim that was to receive a thousand was given ten thousand, at the command\\n\\nof the royal son of Kunti.[31] Like the, clouds vivifying the crops with\\n\\ntheir downpours, that royal cloud gratified the Brahmanas by downpours of\\n\\nwealth. After all those gifts had been distributed, the king, O thou of\\n\\ngreat intelligence, then deluged the assembled guests of all the four\\n\\norders with repeated surges of food and drink of diverge tastes. Verily,\\n\\nthe Dhritarashtra-ocean, swelling high, with jewels and gems for its\\n\\nwaters, rich with the villages and fields and other foremost of gifts\\n\\nconstituting its verdant islands, heaps of diverse kinds of precious\\n\\nhowever, a question, O scorcher of foes, which I wish to ask thee.'\\n\\n\\\"Saudasa said, 'Say, O learned Brahmana, what is in thy mind. I shall\\n\\ncertainly reply unto thy words. I shall dispel whatever doubt may be in\\n\\nthy mind. I have no hesitation in this.'\\n\\n\\\"Utanka said, 'Those who are skilled in the rules of duty say that\\n\\nBrahmanas are of restrained speech. One who behaves wrongly towards\\n\\nfriends is regarded as vile as a thief.'[174] Thou, again, O king, hast\\n\\nbecome my friend today. Do thou then, O foremost of men, give me such\\n\\ncounsel as is approved by the wise. As regards myself, I have now\\n\\nobtained the fruition of my wishes. Thou, again, art a cannibal. Is it\\n\\nproper for me to come back to thee or not?'\\n\\n\\\"Saudasa said, 'If it is proper (for me), O foremost of superior\\n\\nBrahmanas, to say what thou askest, I should then, O best of regenerate\\n\\nones, tell thee that thou shouldst never come back to me. O perpetuator\\n\\nof Bhrigu's race, by acting even thus, thou wilt attain to what is\\n\\nanother in that fearful melee. Indeed, O king, whoever amongst them took\\n\\nup in wrath a few blades of the Eraka grass, these, in his hands, became\\n\\nsoon converted into a thunderbolt, O puissant one. Every blade of grass\\n\\nthere was seen to be converted into a terrible iron bolt. All this, know,\\n\\nO king, was due to the curse denounced by Brahmanas. He who hurled a\\n\\nblade of grass saw that it pierced through even such things as were\\n\\nutterly impenetrable. In fact, every blade was seen to become a terrible\\n\\nbolt having the force of thunder. Son killed sire, and sire killed son, O\\n\\nBharata. Inebriated with wine, they rushed and fell upon one another. The\\n\\nKukuras and the Andhakas met with destruction like insects rushing at a\\n\\nblazing fire. As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them\\n\\nthought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had\\n\\ncome, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything. Indeed,\\n\\nsons of mine who were addicted to calamitous dice. Verily, I desire to\\n\\nmake those gifts, inviting all the people to my mansion.'[26]\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so (to Gandhari), Dhritarashtra\\n\\nsent for Yudhishthira. The latter, at his uncle's command, brought all\\n\\nthe articles necessary. Many Brahmanas residing in Kuru-jangala, and many\\n\\nKshatriyas, many Vaisyas, and many Sudras also, came to Dhritarashtra's\\n\\nmansion, with gratified hearts. The old king, coming out of the inner\\n\\napartments, beheld them all, as also his subjects assembled together.\\n\\nBeholding all those assembled citizens and inhabitants of the provinces,\\n\\nand his well-wishers also thus gathered together, and the large number of\\n\\nBrahmanas arrived from diverge realms, king Dhritarashtra of great\\n\\nintelligence, O monarch, said these words,--'Ye all and the Kurus have\\n\\nlived together for many long years, well-wishers of each other, and each\\n\\nservices which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\\n\\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\\n\\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\\n\\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\\n\\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\\n\\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\\n\\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\\n\\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\\n\\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\\n\\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\\n\\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\\n\\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\\n\\nproceeded to a spot on the margin of Ganga. He then bathed in the sacred\\n\\nstream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.\\n\\nThe wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to\\n\\nburn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt\\n\\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\\n\\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\\n\\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\\n\\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\\n\\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,\\n\\nexceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the\\n\\nconflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,\\n\\nthat foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,--'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a\\n\\nplace where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall\\n\\ndeep affliction. The servants of the Vrishnis, their horsemen, and their\\n\\ncar-warriors too, followed the procession. The citizens and the\\n\\ninhabitants of the country, at the command of Prithas son, set out at the\\n\\nsame time and proceeded, surrounding that cavalcade destitute of heroes\\n\\nand numbering only women and the aged and the children. The warriors who\\n\\nfought from the backs of elephants proceeded on elephants as huge as\\n\\nhills. The foot-soldiers also set out, together with the reserves. The\\n\\nchildren of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, all followed Arjuna. The\\n\\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out,\\n\\nkeeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudevas harem, and\\n\\nVajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna. The widows of the other\\n\\nheroes of the Bhoja, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races, lordless now,\\n\\nthat set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions. That foremost of\\n\\ncar-warriors, that conqueror of hostile towns, the son of Pritha,\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\\n\\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\\n\\nVaishampayana said, \\\"King Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pritha, had not stayed there for more than a moment when, O thou of Kurus race, all the gods with Indra at their head came to that spot. The deity of Righteousness in his embodied form also came to that place where the Kuru king was, for seeing that monarch. Upon the advent of those deities of resplendent bodies and sanctified and noble deeds, the darkness that had overwhelmed that region immediately disappeared. The torments undergone by beings of sinful deeds were no longer seen. The river Vaitarani, the thorny Salmali, the iron jars, and the boulders of rock, so terrible to behold, also vanished from sight. The diverse repulsive corpses also, which the Kuru king had seen, disappeared at the same time. Then a breeze, delicious and fraught with pleasant perfumes, perfectly pure and delightfully cool, O Bharata, began to blow on that spot in consequence of the presence of the gods. The Maruts, with Indra, the Vasus with the\\n\\nas thou likest, O ruler of Earth. Thou, O Bharata. art the Master of this\\n\\nkingdom and of all lives in it. Let the foremost one of Kuru's race give\\n\\naway, for the obsequial rites of his sons, all those foremost of gifts\\n\\nwhich should be given to the Brahmanas. Indeed, let him make those gifts\\n\\nunto persons of the regenerate order, taking away from our mansions\\n\\njewels and gems, and kine, and slaves both mate and female, and goats and\\n\\nsheep. Let gifts be made unto also those that are poor or sightless or in\\n\\ngreat distress, selecting the objects of his charity as he likes. Let, O\\n\\nVidura, large pavilions be constructed, rich with food and drink of\\n\\ndiverse tastes collected in profusion. Let reservoirs of water be\\n\\nconstructed for enabling kine to drink, and let other works of merit be\\n\\naccomplished.--Even these were the words said unto me by the king as also\\n\\nby Pritha's son Dhananjaya. It behoveth thee to say what should be done\\n\\nas before. I can even repeatedly create a different order of things. Let\\n\\ngold and whatever else of wealth there is, come to this place today. Let\\n\\nall the wealth that occurs in the three worlds come here today of its own\\n\\naccord. Let all the tribes of celestial Apsaras, all the Gandharvas along\\n\\nwith the Kinnaras, and Viswavasu, and others there are (of that order),\\n\\napproach this sacrifice of mine. Let all the wealth that exists among the\\n\\nNorthern Kurus, come of their own accord to these sacrifices. Let Heaven,\\n\\nand all those who have Heaven for their home, and Dharma himself, come\\n\\nhither.'--After the ascetic had uttered these words, everything happened\\n\\nas he wished, in consequence of his penances, for Agastya was endued with\\n\\na mind that resembled a blazing fire and was possessed of extraordinary\\n\\nenergy. The Rishis who were there beheld the power of penances with\\n\\nrejoicing hearts. Filled with wonder they then said these words of grave\\n\\nimport.'\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nobsequies, as also of king Somadatta and of Bhurisravas, of the royal\\n\\nsage Valhika, and of the high-souled Drona, and of all others. Our mother\\n\\nKunti shall make such obsequial offerings for Karna. O foremost of men,\\n\\nlet not Dhritarashtra perform those Sraddhas. Even this is what I think.\\n\\nLet not our foes be gladdened. Let Duryodhana and others sink from a\\n\\nmiserable to a more miserable position. Alas, it was those wretches of\\n\\ntheir race that caused the whole Earth to be exterminated. How hast thou\\n\\nbeen able to forget that anxiety of twelve long years, and our residence\\n\\nin deep incognito that was so painful to Draupadi? Where was\\n\\nDhritarashtra's affection for us then? Clad in a black deer-skin and\\n\\ndivested of all thy ornaments, with the princess of Panchala in thy\\n\\ncompany, didst thou not follow this king? Where were Bhishma and Drona\\n\\nthen, and where was Somadatta? Thou hadst to live for thirteen years in\\n\\nthe woods, supporting thyself on the products of the wilderness. Thy\\n\\nThe cackle of thousands of voices made that mountain delightful and\\n\\ncharming. It was adorned with many shops and stalls filled with diverse\\n\\nviands and enjoyable articles. There were heaps of cloths and garlands,\\n\\nand the music of Vinas and flutes and Mridangas was heard everywhere.\\n\\nFood mixed with wines of diverse kinds was stored here and there. Gifts\\n\\nwere being ceaselessly made to those that were distressed, or blind, or\\n\\nhelpless. In consequence of all this, the festival of that mountain\\n\\nbecame highly auspicious. There were many sacred abodes built on the\\n\\nbreast of that mountain, O hero, within which resided many men of\\n\\nrighteous deeds. Even thus did the heroes of Vrishni's race sport in that\\n\\nfestival of Raivataka. Equipt with those mansions, that mountain shone\\n\\nlike a second Heaven. At the arrival of Krishna, O chief of Bharata's\\n\\nrace, that prince of mountains resembled the blessed abode of Indra\\n\\nhimself. Worshipped (by his relatives), Krishna then entered a beautiful\\n\\naccomplished.--Even these were the words said unto me by the king as also\\n\\nby Pritha's son Dhananjaya. It behoveth thee to say what should be done\\n\\nnext. After Vidura had said these words, O Janamejaya, Dhritarashtra his\\n\\nsatisfaction at them and set his heart upon making large presents on the\\n\\nday of full moon in the month of Kartika.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said,--'Thus addressed by Vidura, king Dhritarashtra became\\n\\nhighly pleased, O monarch, with the act of Yudhishthira and Jishnu.\\n\\nInviting then, after proper examination, thousands of deserving Brahmanas\\n\\nand superior Rishis, for the sake of Bhishma, as also of his sons and\\n\\nfriends, and causing a large quantity of food and drink to be prepared,\\n\\nand cars and other vehicles and clothes, and gold and jewels and gems,\\n\\nand slaves both male and female, and goats and sheep, and blankets and\\n\\ncostly articles to be collected, and villages and fields, and other kines\"]}": {

Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nArjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.\\n\\nEquipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake\\n\\npenetrating on an anthill. Piercing the son of Kunti through, the shaft\\n\\nwent deep into the Earth. Feeling acute pain, the intelligent Dhananjaya\\n\\nrested awhile, supporting himself on his excellent bow. He stood, having\\n\\nrecourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like\\n\\none deprived of life. That foremost of men, then regaining consciousness,\\n\\npraised his son highly.

O\\n\\nson, beholding this feat, so worthy of thee, I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I shall now shoot these arrows at thee, O son. Stand for fight\\n\\n(without running away).' Having said these words, that slayer of foes\\n\\nshot a shower of arrows on the prince. King Vabhruvahana, however, with\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee.

The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just.

In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee.

Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter.

Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nof Magadha, yet the latter thinking that his body was protected by his\\n\\nown prowess, shot many arrows at Partha. The wielder of Gandiva, deeply\\n\\nstruck by the prince of Magadha, shone like a flowering Palasa (Butea\\n\\nfrondosa) in the season of spring. Arjuna had no desire of slaying the\\n\\nprince of Magadha. It was for this that, having struck the son of Pandu,\\n\\nhe succeeded in remaining before that foremost of heroes. Then\\n\\nDhananjaya, becoming angry, drew his bow with great force, and slew his\\n\\nantagonist's steeds and then struck off the head of his car-driver. With\\n\\na razor-headed shaft he then cut off Meghasandhi's large and beautiful\\n\\nbow, and then his leathern fence. Then cutting off his flag and\\n\\nflag-staff, he caused it to fall down. The prince of Magadha, exceedingly\\n\\nafflicted, and deprived of his steeds and bow and driver, took up a mace\\n\\nand rushed with great speed at the son of Kunti. Arjuna then with many\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\\n\\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\\n\\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\\n\\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,\\n\\npractised penances. I have no fear of death.'\\n\\n\\\"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's\\n\\noffspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,\\n\\nagain, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by\\n\\nthy own self (in the form of thy son).'\\n\\n\\\"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in\\n\\nself-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various\\n\\noccasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O\\n\\nYudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.--Do thou command, O\\n\\nmonarch, what gifts should be made to these. All things are ready\\n\\nhere.--As soon as the king spoke, they gave away what he directed.[30]\\n\\nUnto him that was to receive a hundred, a thousand was given, and unto\\n\\nhim that was to receive a thousand was given ten thousand, at the command\\n\\nof the royal son of Kunti.[31] Like the, clouds vivifying the crops with\\n\\ntheir downpours, that royal cloud gratified the Brahmanas by downpours of\\n\\nwealth. After all those gifts had been distributed, the king, O thou of\\n\\ngreat intelligence, then deluged the assembled guests of all the four\\n\\norders with repeated surges of food and drink of diverge tastes. Verily,\\n\\nthe Dhritarashtra-ocean, swelling high, with jewels and gems for its\\n\\nwaters, rich with the villages and fields and other foremost of gifts\\n\\nconstituting its verdant islands, heaps of diverse kinds of precious\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nsons of mine who were addicted to calamitous dice. Verily, I desire to\\n\\nmake those gifts, inviting all the people to my mansion.'[26]\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so (to Gandhari), Dhritarashtra\\n\\nsent for Yudhishthira. The latter, at his uncle's command, brought all\\n\\nthe articles necessary. Many Brahmanas residing in Kuru-jangala, and many\\n\\nKshatriyas, many Vaisyas, and many Sudras also, came to Dhritarashtra's\\n\\nmansion, with gratified hearts. The old king, coming out of the inner\\n\\napartments, beheld them all, as also his subjects assembled together.\\n\\nBeholding all those assembled citizens and inhabitants of the provinces,\\n\\nand his well-wishers also thus gathered together, and the large number of\\n\\nBrahmanas arrived from diverge realms, king Dhritarashtra of great\\n\\nintelligence, O monarch, said these words,--'Ye all and the Kurus have\\n\\nlived together for many long years, well-wishers of each other, and each\\n\\ntherefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley. My body,\\n\\nlife-breaths, and religious rites have all one purpose viz., the service\\n\\nof my senior. Through thy grace, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain many\\n\\nregions of happiness hereafter. I deserve to be looked after by thee.\\n\\nKnow, O regenerate one, that I am wholly devoted to thee. Cherishing also\\n\\nthis thought, viz., that my happiness is thy concern, it behoveth thee to\\n\\ntake this my share of the barley.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O chaste lady, in consequence of such conduct\\n\\nof thine thou wilt for ever shine in glory, for endued with vows and\\n\\nsteadiness in religious rites, thy eyes are directed to that conduct\\n\\nwhich should be observed towards seniors. Therefore, O daughter-in-law, I\\n\\nshall take thy share of the barley. Thou deservest not to be deceived by\\n\\nme, reckoning all thy virtues. Thou art truly, O blessed damsel, the\\n\\nforemost of all persons observing the duties of righteousness.' Having\\n\\n\\\"Bhishma of mighty energy and great effulgence attained to the status of the Vasus. Eight Vasus, O chief of Bharatas race, are now seen. Drona entered into Brihaspati, that foremost one of Angirasas descendants. Hridikas son Kritavarma entered the Maruts. Pradyumna entered Sanatkumara whence he had issued. Dhritarashtra obtained the regions, so difficult of acquisition, that belong to the Lord of treasures. The famous Gandhari obtained the same regions with her husband Dhritarashtra. With his two wives, Pandu proceeded to the abode of the great Indra. Both Virata and Drupada, the king Dhrishtaketu, as also Nishatha, Akrura, Samva, Bhanukampa, and Viduratha, and Bhurishrava and Sala and king Bhuri, and Kansa, and Ugrasena, and Vasudeva, and Uttara, that foremost of men, with his brother Sankhaall these foremost of persons entered the deities. Somas son of great prowess, named Varchas of mighty energy, became Abhimanyu, the son of Phalguna, that lion among men. Having fought, agreeably\\n\\ncontinuous practice. They focused on their goals. It was regular practice, dedication and commitment of Arjuna which made him powerful during war and he defeated great warriors of Kauravas. After the loss of their kingdom, Pandavas tried to work on their weaknesses and learned new skills. Arjuna utilized the time during their exile to acquire new weapons. Yudhishthra acquired teachings from various Rishis and learned the game of dice. Business promoters must experience their products and plans in order to survive in long run. They need to concentrate on continuous improvement for the success of business. 3.15 Women empowerment Women empowerment means participation of women in decision making. Participation of women in decision making helps to view the situation in holistic way. Harmonious, feminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed\\n\\nas thou likest, O ruler of Earth. Thou, O Bharata. art the Master of this\\n\\nkingdom and of all lives in it. Let the foremost one of Kuru's race give\\n\\naway, for the obsequial rites of his sons, all those foremost of gifts\\n\\nwhich should be given to the Brahmanas. Indeed, let him make those gifts\\n\\nunto persons of the regenerate order, taking away from our mansions\\n\\njewels and gems, and kine, and slaves both mate and female, and goats and\\n\\nsheep. Let gifts be made unto also those that are poor or sightless or in\\n\\ngreat distress, selecting the objects of his charity as he likes. Let, O\\n\\nVidura, large pavilions be constructed, rich with food and drink of\\n\\ndiverse tastes collected in profusion. Let reservoirs of water be\\n\\nconstructed for enabling kine to drink, and let other works of merit be\\n\\naccomplished.--Even these were the words said unto me by the king as also\\n\\nby Pritha's son Dhananjaya. It behoveth thee to say what should be done\\n\\nservices which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\\n\\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\\n\\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\\n\\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\\n\\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\\n\\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\\n\\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\\n\\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\\n\\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\\n\\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\\n\\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\\n\\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\\n\\ndrinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold and other precious metals should be given as Dakshina. The names should then be taken of all the deities as also of Nara and Narayana. Then, adorning the persons of some foremost of Brahmanas with scents and garlands, they should be gratified with diverse kinds of gifts of enjoyable and very superior or costly articles. By doing this, one attains to the merits of the Atiratra sacrifice. Indeed, at each successive Parva, he acquires the merits that attach to the performance of a sacrifice. The reciter, O chief of the Bharatas, should be possessed of learning and endued with a good voice and a clear utterance respecting both letters and words. Even such a man should, O chief of the Bharatas, recite the Bharata. After entertaining a number of foremost Brahmanas, presents should be made unto them according to the ordinances. The reciter also, O chief of the Bharatas, should be decked with ornaments and fed sumptuously.

Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nInference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently. Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\\n\\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\\n\\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\\n\\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,\\n\\npractised penances. I have no fear of death.'\\n\\n\\\"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's\\n\\noffspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,\\n\\nagain, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by\\n\\nthy own self (in the form of thy son).'\\n\\n\\\"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in\\n\\nself-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various\\n\\noccasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O\\n\\nevoke any god and she will get a child. She is curious and tried experimenting when the condition isn\\u2019t right, she evoked the Sun god while she is not married. Result : Karna is born and she has to let him go fearing the norms of the society. She gave birth to a talented fellow who is discriminated through out his life just because of his caste? What a shame. What is the outcome of unprepared experimentation? A soul is always deprived of his legacy, a soul who is deprived of what he deserves, guilt followed by \\u201cDharmasankat\\u201d. Inference: You can do experiments but wait for the right time and situation. Do not cross the line, premature experimentation can lead to dangerous outcomes and you will have guilt all through your life. Be Diplomatic \\u2013 Pen is Mightier than the Sword: Madri King Pandu was on his quest to expand the borders of Hastinapur\\u2019s empire. He decided to attack the kingdom of Madra. Madri was the princess of Madra and she secretly adored Pandu. But Madra king was not in\\n\\nbest of thy power. I have no anger.' Thus addressed, the ruler of Magadha\\n\\nfirst struck the son of Pandu, showering his arrows on him like the\\n\\nthousand-eyed Indra showering heavy downpour of rain. Then, O chief of\\n\\nBharata's race, the heroic wielder of Gandiva, with shafts sped from his\\n\\nexcellent bow, baffled all the arrows shot carefully at him by his\\n\\nantagonist. Having thus baffled that cloud of arrows, the ape-bannered\\n\\nhero sped a number of blazing arrows at his foe that resembled snakes\\n\\nwith fiery mouths. These arrows he shot at his flag and flag-staff and\\n\\ncar and poles and yoke and the horses, sparing the body of his foe and\\n\\nhis car-driver. Though Partha who was capable of shooting the bow with\\n\\nthe left hand (as well as with the right) spared the body of the prince\\n\\nof Magadha, yet the latter thinking that his body was protected by his\\n\\nown prowess, shot many arrows at Partha. The wielder of Gandiva, deeply\\n\\nYudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.--Do thou command, O\\n\\nmonarch, what gifts should be made to these. All things are ready\\n\\nhere.--As soon as the king spoke, they gave away what he directed.[30]\\n\\nUnto him that was to receive a hundred, a thousand was given, and unto\\n\\nhim that was to receive a thousand was given ten thousand, at the command\\n\\nof the royal son of Kunti.[31] Like the, clouds vivifying the crops with\\n\\ntheir downpours, that royal cloud gratified the Brahmanas by downpours of\\n\\nwealth. After all those gifts had been distributed, the king, O thou of\\n\\ngreat intelligence, then deluged the assembled guests of all the four\\n\\norders with repeated surges of food and drink of diverge tastes. Verily,\\n\\nthe Dhritarashtra-ocean, swelling high, with jewels and gems for its\\n\\nwaters, rich with the villages and fields and other foremost of gifts\\n\\nconstituting its verdant islands, heaps of diverse kinds of precious\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nfaces towards battle, they have attained to those regions which are for\\n\\nwielders of weapons.[4] I should now accomplish what is beneficial and\\n\\nmeritorious for me as also for Gandhari. It behoveth thee, O great king,\\n\\nto grant me permission. Thou art the foremost of all righteous persons.\\n\\nThou art always devoted to righteousness. The king is the preceptor of\\n\\nall creatures. It is for this that I say so. With thy permission, O hero,\\n\\nI shall retire into the woods, clad in rags and barks. O king, alone with\\n\\nthis Gandhari, I shall live in the woods, always blessing thee. It is\\n\\nmeet, O son, for the members of our race, to make over sovereignty, when\\n\\nold age comes, to children and lead the forest mode of life. Subsisting\\n\\nthere on air alone, or abstaining from all food, I shall, with this wife\\n\\nof mine, O hero, practise severe austerities. Thou shalt be a sharer of\\n\\nthese penances, O son, for thou art the king. Kings are sharers of both\\n\\nsons of mine who were addicted to calamitous dice. Verily, I desire to\\n\\nmake those gifts, inviting all the people to my mansion.'[26]\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so (to Gandhari), Dhritarashtra\\n\\nsent for Yudhishthira. The latter, at his uncle's command, brought all\\n\\nthe articles necessary. Many Brahmanas residing in Kuru-jangala, and many\\n\\nKshatriyas, many Vaisyas, and many Sudras also, came to Dhritarashtra's\\n\\nmansion, with gratified hearts. The old king, coming out of the inner\\n\\napartments, beheld them all, as also his subjects assembled together.\\n\\nBeholding all those assembled citizens and inhabitants of the provinces,\\n\\nand his well-wishers also thus gathered together, and the large number of\\n\\nBrahmanas arrived from diverge realms, king Dhritarashtra of great\\n\\nintelligence, O monarch, said these words,--'Ye all and the Kurus have\\n\\nlived together for many long years, well-wishers of each other, and each\\n\\ntherefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley. My body,\\n\\nlife-breaths, and religious rites have all one purpose viz., the service\\n\\nof my senior. Through thy grace, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain many\\n\\nregions of happiness hereafter. I deserve to be looked after by thee.\\n\\nKnow, O regenerate one, that I am wholly devoted to thee. Cherishing also\\n\\nthis thought, viz., that my happiness is thy concern, it behoveth thee to\\n\\ntake this my share of the barley.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O chaste lady, in consequence of such conduct\\n\\nof thine thou wilt for ever shine in glory, for endued with vows and\\n\\nsteadiness in religious rites, thy eyes are directed to that conduct\\n\\nwhich should be observed towards seniors. Therefore, O daughter-in-law, I\\n\\nshall take thy share of the barley. Thou deservest not to be deceived by\\n\\nme, reckoning all thy virtues. Thou art truly, O blessed damsel, the\\n\\nforemost of all persons observing the duties of righteousness.' Having\\n\\n(King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\ncomes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context. If you do not change your decision making instinct with the context, prepare for a storm, prepare for the \\u201cMahabharata\\u201d.\\n\\nfeathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\\n\\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\\n\\nGandhari and Kunti and Draupadi, and she of the Sattwata race, and other\\n\\nladies of the royal household also sat down. The conversation that then\\n\\narose was excellent and had reference to topics connected with piety, and\\n\\nthe Rishis of old, and the deities and the Asuras. At the close of that\\n\\nconversation Vyasa of great energy, that foremost of eloquent men, that\\n\\nfirst of all persons conversant with the Vedas, highly gratified,\\n\\naddressed the blind monarch and once more said,--'Burning as thou art\\n\\nwith grief on account of thy children, I know, O king of kings, what\\n\\nobject is cherished by thee in thy heart. The sorrow that always exists\\n\\nin the heart of Gandhari, that which exists in the heart of Kunti, and\\n\\nthat also which is cherished by Draupadi in her heart, and that burning\\n\\ngrief, on account of the death of her son, which Krishna's sister\\n\\nas thou likest, O ruler of Earth. Thou, O Bharata. art the Master of this\\n\\nkingdom and of all lives in it. Let the foremost one of Kuru's race give\\n\\naway, for the obsequial rites of his sons, all those foremost of gifts\\n\\nwhich should be given to the Brahmanas. Indeed, let him make those gifts\\n\\nunto persons of the regenerate order, taking away from our mansions\\n\\njewels and gems, and kine, and slaves both mate and female, and goats and\\n\\nsheep. Let gifts be made unto also those that are poor or sightless or in\\n\\ngreat distress, selecting the objects of his charity as he likes. Let, O\\n\\nVidura, large pavilions be constructed, rich with food and drink of\\n\\ndiverse tastes collected in profusion. Let reservoirs of water be\\n\\nconstructed for enabling kine to drink, and let other works of merit be\\n\\naccomplished.--Even these were the words said unto me by the king as also\\n\\nby Pritha's son Dhananjaya. It behoveth thee to say what should be done\\n\\nservices which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\\n\\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\\n\\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\\n\\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\\n\\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\\n\\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\\n\\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\\n\\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\\n\\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\\n\\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\\n\\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\\n\\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\\n\\nto both prosperity and adversity. Does she still grieve? Does Kunti, O\\n\\nking, who in consequence of her devotion to the service of her seniors,\\n\\nleft her children, attend to thy wants and serve thee with all humility?\\n\\nHave the high-minded and high-souled king, Yudhishthira, the son of\\n\\nDharma and Bhima and Arjuna and the twins been sufficiently comforted?\\n\\nDost thou feet delight at seeing them? Has thy mind become freed from\\n\\nevery stain? Has thy disposition, O king, become pure in consequence of\\n\\nthe increase of thy knowledge? This aggregate of three, O king, is the\\n\\nforemost of all concerns, O Bharata, viz., abstension from injury to any\\n\\ncreature, truth, and freedom from anger. Does thy forest life any longer\\n\\nprove painful to thee? Art thou able to earn with thy own exertions the\\n\\nproducts of the wilderness for thy food? Do fasts give thee any pain now?\\n\\nHast thou learnt, O king, how the high-souled Vidura, who was Dharma's\\n\\nmagic (instead of any human agency). The Kaurava hero, piercing the\\n\\nhostile host with showers of arrows, looked resplendent like the autumnal\\n\\nSun when he disperses the clouds with his powerful rays.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXVIII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The irresistible wielder of Gandiva, addresst for\\n\\nbattle, stood immovable on the field like Himavat himself. The Saindhava\\n\\nwarriors, once more rallying, showered in great wrath repeated down-pours\\n\\nof shifts on him. The mighty-armed hero, laughing at his foes, who had\\n\\nonce more rallied but who were on the point of death, addressed them in\\n\\nthese soft words,--'Do ye fight to the best of your power and do ye\\n\\nendeavour to vanquish me. Do ye however, accomplish all necessary acts,\\n\\nfor a great danger awaits you all. See, I fight all of you, baffling your\\n\\nclouds of arrows. Bent as you are on battle, tarry a little. I shall soon\\n\\nquell your pride.' The wielder of Gandiva, having said these words in\\n\\na complexion as darkish as that of the blue lotus, she who sits there on\\n\\nthe earth, and whose eyes are as expansive as lotus-petals, is the wife\\n\\nof the eldest son of Madravati, This lady whose complexion is as fair as\\n\\nthat of heated gold and who sits with her child on her lap, is the\\n\\ndaughter of king Virata. She is the wife of that Abhimanyu who, while\\n\\ndivested of his car, was slain by Drona and others fighting from their\\n\\ncars.[41] These ladies, the hair on whose heads shows not the parted\\n\\nline, and who are clad in white, are the widows of the slain sons of\\n\\nDhritarashtra. They are the daughters-in-law of this old king, the wives\\n\\nof his hundred sons, now deprived of both their husbands and children who\\n\\nhave been slain by heroic foes. I have now pointed them out in the order\\n\\nof precedence. In consequence of their devotion to Brahmanas, their\\n\\nunderstandings and hearts are divested of every kind of crookedness.\\n\\naccomplished.--Even these were the words said unto me by the king as also\\n\\nby Pritha's son Dhananjaya.

Those foremost of\\n\\nsteeds, numbering four, (Saivya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Valahaka), and\\n\\nendued with the speed of thought, fled away, dragging the car after them\\n\\nalong the surface of the ocean. The two great standards of Krishnas car\\n\\nand Valadevas car, that with the device of Garuda and that bearing the\\n\\ndevice of the palmyra, which were reverently worshipped by those two\\n\\nheroes, were taken away by Apsaras who, day and night, called upon the\\n\\nVrishnis and the Andhakas to set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred\\n\\nwater. When these omens were seen and heard, those foremost of men, the\\n\\nmighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, became desirous of\\n\\nrace, that prince of mountains resembled the blessed abode of Indra\\n\\nhimself. Worshipped (by his relatives), Krishna then entered a beautiful\\n\\nmansion. Satyaki also went to his own quarters with a delighted soul.\\n\\nGovinda entered his residence after a long absence, having accomplished\\n\\nfeats of great difficulty like Vasava amid the Danava host. The heroes of\\n\\nthe Bhoja, Vrishni, and Andhaka races, all came forward to receive that\\n\\nhigh-souled one like the deities advancing to receive him of a hundred\\n\\nsacrifices. Endued with great intelligence, he honoured them in return\\n\\nand enquired after their welfare. With a gratified heart he then saluted\\n\\nhis father and mother. The mighty-armed hero was embraced by both of them\\n\\nand comforted too (by numerous evidences of affection). He then took his\\n\\nseat with all the Vrishnis sitting around him. Having washed his feet and\\n\\ndispelled his fatigue, Krishna of mighty energy, as he sat there, then\\n\\nfor the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nhave all been consumed by the Brahmanas curse. O chief of Kurus race, it\\n\\nbehoveth thee not to grieve for their destruction. That which has\\n\\nhappened had been ordained. It was the destiny of those high-souled\\n\\nwarriors. Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully\\n\\ncompetent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the\\n\\nuniverse with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be\\n\\nsaid of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? He who used to proceed\\n\\nin front of thy car, armed with discus and mace, through affection for\\n\\nthee, was the four-armed Vasudeva, that ancient rishi. That high-souled\\n\\none of expansive eyes, Krishna, having lightened the burthen of the Earth\\n\\nand cast off his (human) body, has attained to his own high seat. By thee\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\\n\\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\\n\\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\\n\\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,\\n\\npractised penances. I have no fear of death.'\\n\\n\\\"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's\\n\\noffspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,\\n\\nagain, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by\\n\\nthy own self (in the form of thy son).'\\n\\n\\\"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in\\n\\nself-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various\\n\\noccasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nYudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.--Do thou command, O\\n\\nmonarch, what gifts should be made to these. All things are ready\\n\\nhere.--As soon as the king spoke, they gave away what he directed.[30]\\n\\nUnto him that was to receive a hundred, a thousand was given, and unto\\n\\nhim that was to receive a thousand was given ten thousand, at the command\\n\\nof the royal son of Kunti.[31] Like the, clouds vivifying the crops with\\n\\ntheir downpours, that royal cloud gratified the Brahmanas by downpours of\\n\\nwealth. After all those gifts had been distributed, the king, O thou of\\n\\ngreat intelligence, then deluged the assembled guests of all the four\\n\\norders with repeated surges of food and drink of diverge tastes. Verily,\\n\\nthe Dhritarashtra-ocean, swelling high, with jewels and gems for its\\n\\nwaters, rich with the villages and fields and other foremost of gifts\\n\\nconstituting its verdant islands, heaps of diverse kinds of precious\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nonce more addressed Vidura and said, 'It behoves not king Dhritarashtra\\n\\nto be angry with Bhimasena. This Bhima of great intelligence was greatly\\n\\nafflicted by cold and rain and heat and by a thousand other griefs while\\n\\nresiding in the woods. All this is not unknown to thee. Do thou, however,\\n\\ninstructed by me, say unto the king, O foremost one of Bharata's race,\\n\\nthat he may take from my house whatever articles he wishes and in\\n\\nwhatever measure also he likes. Thou shalt also tell the king that he\\n\\nshould not allow his heart to dwell on this exhibition of pride in which\\n\\nBhima, deeply afflicted, has indulged. Whatever wealth I have and\\n\\nwhatever Arjuna has in his house, the owner thereof is king\\n\\nDhritarashtra. Even this thou shouldst tell him. Let the king make gifts\\n\\nunto the Brahmanas. Let him spend as largely as he likes. Let him free\\n\\nhimself from the debt he owes to his sons and well-wishers. Let him be\\n\\ntold besides,--O Monarch, this very body of mine is at thy disposal and\\n\\ntherefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley. My body,\\n\\nlife-breaths, and religious rites have all one purpose viz., the service\\n\\nof my senior. Through thy grace, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain many\\n\\nregions of happiness hereafter. I deserve to be looked after by thee.\\n\\nKnow, O regenerate one, that I am wholly devoted to thee. Cherishing also\\n\\nthis thought, viz., that my happiness is thy concern, it behoveth thee to\\n\\ntake this my share of the barley.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O chaste lady, in consequence of such conduct\\n\\nof thine thou wilt for ever shine in glory, for endued with vows and\\n\\nsteadiness in religious rites, thy eyes are directed to that conduct\\n\\nwhich should be observed towards seniors. Therefore, O daughter-in-law, I\\n\\nshall take thy share of the barley. Thou deservest not to be deceived by\\n\\nme, reckoning all thy virtues. Thou art truly, O blessed damsel, the\\n\\nforemost of all persons observing the duties of righteousness.' Having\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\n\\\"One desirous of hearing the Bharata, should hear it without a doubting heart, with cheerfulness and joy; and as, he proceeds listening to its recitation, he should according to the extent of his power, make gifts with great devotion.\\n\\nservices which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\\n\\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\\n\\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\\n\\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\\n\\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\\n\\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\\n\\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\\n\\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\\n\\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\\n\\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\\n\\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\\n\\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\ndeep affliction. The servants of the Vrishnis, their horsemen, and their\\n\\ncar-warriors too, followed the procession. The citizens and the\\n\\ninhabitants of the country, at the command of Prithas son, set out at the\\n\\nsame time and proceeded, surrounding that cavalcade destitute of heroes\\n\\nand numbering only women and the aged and the children. The warriors who\\n\\nfought from the backs of elephants proceeded on elephants as huge as\\n\\nhills. The foot-soldiers also set out, together with the reserves. The\\n\\nchildren of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, all followed Arjuna. The\\n\\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out,\\n\\nkeeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudevas harem, and\\n\\nVajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna. The widows of the other\\n\\nheroes of the Bhoja, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races, lordless now,\\n\\nthat set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions. That foremost of\\n\\ncar-warriors, that conqueror of hostile towns, the son of Pritha,\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No\\n\\naccomplished.--Even these were the words said unto me by the king as also\\n\\nby Pritha's son Dhananjaya. It behoveth thee to say what should be done\\n\\nnext. After Vidura had said these words, O Janamejaya, Dhritarashtra his\\n\\nsatisfaction at them and set his heart upon making large presents on the\\n\\nday of full moon in the month of Kartika.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said,--'Thus addressed by Vidura, king Dhritarashtra became\\n\\nhighly pleased, O monarch, with the act of Yudhishthira and Jishnu.\\n\\nInviting then, after proper examination, thousands of deserving Brahmanas\\n\\nand superior Rishis, for the sake of Bhishma, as also of his sons and\\n\\nfriends, and causing a large quantity of food and drink to be prepared,\\n\\nand cars and other vehicles and clothes, and gold and jewels and gems,\\n\\nand slaves both male and female, and goats and sheep, and blankets and\\n\\ncostly articles to be collected, and villages and fields, and other kines\"]}": {

Their stories highlight the epic's central themes of duty, destiny, friendship, and the complexities of morality.\\n\\n**Similarities:**\\n\\n* **Exceptional Skill:** Both Karna and Arjuna are unparalleled warriors, masters of archery and renowned for their strength and prowess. They are both considered divine archers, blessed with celestial weapons and unmatched skill.\\n* **Noble Qualities:** Despite their opposing sides, both possess admirable qualities. Karna is known for his loyalty, courage, and generosity, while Arjuna embodies discipline, righteousness, and unwavering devotion to duty.\\n* **Tragic Fates:** Both characters experience profound tragedy. Karna's birth as a son of a Kshatriya and a charioteer's daughter leads to his ostracization and a life of struggle. Arjuna, despite being a prince, faces internal conflicts and the agony of war, ultimately leading to the destruction of his family and the loss of loved ones.\\n* **Divine Connections:** Both are connected to divine beings. Karna is the son of Surya, the sun god, while Arjuna is the son of Indra, the king of gods. These divine connections contribute to their exceptional abilities but also complicate their choices and destinies.\\n\\n**Differences:**\\n\\n* **Upbringing and Social Standing:** Karna's upbringing as a charioteer's son shapes his sense of injustice and fuels his desire for recognition. Arjuna, on the other hand, enjoys a privileged upbringing as a prince, surrounded by love and support.\\n* **Moral Compass:** While both face moral dilemmas, Arjuna ultimately aligns himself with righteousness and duty, guided by Krishna's counsel. Karna, despite his noble qualities, is bound by his loyalty to Duryodhana, leading him to choose a path that ultimately brings him destruction.\\n* **Choices and Actions:** Arjuna, despite his initial hesitation, ultimately chooses to fight for righteousness, even though it means facing his own kin. Karna, driven by his loyalty to Duryodhana, chooses a path of conflict, even though he recognizes the injustice of the Kauravas' cause.\\n\\n**Contribution to the Epic's Themes:**\\n\\nThe parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna highlight the epic's central themes:\\n\\n* **The Complexity of Morality:** Both characters embody the struggle between duty and personal desires, showcasing the ambiguity of right and wrong.\\n* **The Power of Choice:** Despite their divine connections, both characters ultimately make choices that shape their destinies, demonstrating the power of free will.\\n* **The Consequences of Loyalty:** Karna's unwavering loyalty to Duryodhana leads to his downfall, highlighting the dangers of blind allegiance.\\n* **The Importance of Dharma:** Arjuna's adherence to dharma, even when it is painful, emphasizes the importance of righteousness and duty.\\n\\nKarna and Arjuna's contrasting paths serve as a reminder that even those with similar talents and potential can choose different destinies based on their choices and the influence of their environment and relationships. Their stories offer a profound reflection on the complexities of human nature and the enduring power of choices.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n

There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\\n\\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\\n\\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\\n\\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,\\n\\npractised penances. I have no fear of death.'\\n\\n\\\"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's\\n\\noffspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,\\n\\nagain, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by\\n\\nthy own self (in the form of thy son).'\\n\\n\\\"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in\\n\\nself-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various\\n\\noccasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O\\n\\n\\\"One desirous of hearing the Bharata, should hear it without a doubting heart, with cheerfulness and joy; and as, he proceeds listening to its recitation, he should according to the extent of his power, make gifts with great devotion.\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n6\\n\\nJanamejaya said, \\\"O holy one, according to what rites should the learned listen to the Bharata?

Tell me all this!\\n\\ntherefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley. My body,\\n\\nlife-breaths, and religious rites have all one purpose viz., the service\\n\\nof my senior. Through thy grace, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain many\\n\\nregions of happiness hereafter. I deserve to be looked after by thee.\\n\\nKnow, O regenerate one, that I am wholly devoted to thee. Cherishing also\\n\\nthis thought, viz., that my happiness is thy concern, it behoveth thee to\\n\\ntake this my share of the barley.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O chaste lady, in consequence of such conduct\\n\\nof thine thou wilt for ever shine in glory, for endued with vows and\\n\\nsteadiness in religious rites, thy eyes are directed to that conduct\\n\\nwhich should be observed towards seniors. Therefore, O daughter-in-law, I\\n\\nshall take thy share of the barley. Thou deservest not to be deceived by\\n\\nme, reckoning all thy virtues. Thou art truly, O blessed damsel, the\\n\\nforemost of all persons observing the duties of righteousness.' Having\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nYudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.--Do thou command, O\\n\\nmonarch, what gifts should be made to these. All things are ready\\n\\nhere.--As soon as the king spoke, they gave away what he directed.[30]\\n\\nUnto him that was to receive a hundred, a thousand was given, and unto\\n\\nhim that was to receive a thousand was given ten thousand, at the command\\n\\nof the royal son of Kunti.[31] Like the, clouds vivifying the crops with\\n\\ntheir downpours, that royal cloud gratified the Brahmanas by downpours of\\n\\nwealth. After all those gifts had been distributed, the king, O thou of\\n\\ngreat intelligence, then deluged the assembled guests of all the four\\n\\norders with repeated surges of food and drink of diverge tastes. Verily,\\n\\nthe Dhritarashtra-ocean, swelling high, with jewels and gems for its\\n\\nwaters, rich with the villages and fields and other foremost of gifts\\n\\nconstituting its verdant islands, heaps of diverse kinds of precious\\n\\nservices which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\\n\\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\\n\\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\\n\\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\\n\\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\\n\\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\\n\\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\\n\\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\\n\\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\\n\\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\\n\\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\\n\\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\\n\\nArjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.\\n\\nEquipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake\\n\\npenetrating on an anthill. Piercing the son of Kunti through, the shaft\\n\\nwent deep into the Earth. Feeling acute pain, the intelligent Dhananjaya\\n\\nrested awhile, supporting himself on his excellent bow. He stood, having\\n\\nrecourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like\\n\\none deprived of life. That foremost of men, then regaining consciousness,\\n\\npraised his son highly. Possessed of great splendour, the son of Sakra\\n\\nsaid, 'Excellent, Excellent, O mighty-armed one, O son of Chitrangada! O\\n\\nson, beholding this feat, so worthy of thee, I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I shall now shoot these arrows at thee, O son. Stand for fight\\n\\n(without running away).' Having said these words, that slayer of foes\\n\\nshot a shower of arrows on the prince. King Vabhruvahana, however, with\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No\\n\\nas thou likest, O ruler of Earth. Thou, O Bharata. art the Master of this\\n\\nkingdom and of all lives in it. Let the foremost one of Kuru's race give\\n\\naway, for the obsequial rites of his sons, all those foremost of gifts\\n\\nwhich should be given to the Brahmanas. Indeed, let him make those gifts\\n\\nunto persons of the regenerate order, taking away from our mansions\\n\\njewels and gems, and kine, and slaves both mate and female, and goats and\\n\\nsheep. Let gifts be made unto also those that are poor or sightless or in\\n\\ngreat distress, selecting the objects of his charity as he likes. Let, O\\n\\nVidura, large pavilions be constructed, rich with food and drink of\\n\\ndiverse tastes collected in profusion. Let reservoirs of water be\\n\\nconstructed for enabling kine to drink, and let other works of merit be\\n\\naccomplished.--Even these were the words said unto me by the king as also\\n\\nby Pritha's son Dhananjaya. It behoveth thee to say what should be done\"]}": {

The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness.

He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself.

Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee.

For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes.

He addressed Arjuna, saying, O thou of great intelligence, it is Time that cooks every creature (in his cauldron). I think that what has happened is due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all). It behoveth thee also to see it.\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\\n\\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\\n\\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\\n\\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,\\n\\npractised penances. I have no fear of death.'\\n\\n\\\"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's\\n\\noffspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,\\n\\nagain, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by\\n\\nthy own self (in the form of thy son).'\\n\\n\\\"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in\\n\\nself-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various\\n\\noccasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. Empathy\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nthose heroes could not believe. In fact the destruction of the wielder of\\n\\nSaranga was incredible to them. Informed of the incident about the iron\\n\\nbolt, the Pandavas became filled with grief and sorrow. In fact, they sat\\n\\ndown, utterly cheerless and penetrated with blank despair.\\\"\\n\\nJanamejaya said: \\\"Indeed, O holy one, how was it that the Andhakas along\\n\\nwith Vrishnis, and those great car-warriors, the Bhojas, met with\\n\\ndestruction in the very sight of Vasudeva?\\\"\\n\\nVaishampayana continued: \\\"When the thirty-sixth year was reached (after\\n\\nthe great battle) a great calamity overtook the Vrishnis. Impelled by\\n\\nTime, they all met with destruction in consequence of the iron bolt.\\\"\\n\\nJanamejaya said: \\\"Cursed by whom did those heroes, the Vrishnis, the\\n\\nAndhakas, and the Bhojas, met with destruction? O foremost regenerate\\n\\npersons, do thou tell me this in detail.\\n\\nVaishampayana continued: \\\"One day, the Vrishni heroes numbering Sarana\\n\\nof precedence. In consequence of their devotion to Brahmanas, their\\n\\nunderstandings and hearts are divested of every kind of crookedness.\\n\\nPossessed of pure souls, they have all been pointed out by me,--these\\n\\nprincesses of the Kaurava house-hold,--in answer to your queries.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus that king of Kuru's race, of very advanced\\n\\nyears, having met with those sons of him that was a deity among men.\\n\\nenquired about their welfare after all the ascetics had gone away. The\\n\\nwarriors who had accompanied the Pandavas, leaving the retreat, sat\\n\\nthemselves down at a little distance, alighting from their cars and the\\n\\nanimals they rode. Indeed, after all the crowd, viz., the ladies, the old\\n\\nmen, and the children, had been seated, the old king duly addressed them,\\n\\nmaking the usual enquiries of politeness.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XXVI\\n\\n\\\"Dhritarashtra said. 'O Yudhishthira, art thou in peace and happiness,\\n\\nwith all thy brothers and the inhabitants of the city and the provinces?\\n\\nsons of mine who were addicted to calamitous dice. Verily, I desire to\\n\\nmake those gifts, inviting all the people to my mansion.'[26]\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so (to Gandhari), Dhritarashtra\\n\\nsent for Yudhishthira. The latter, at his uncle's command, brought all\\n\\nthe articles necessary. Many Brahmanas residing in Kuru-jangala, and many\\n\\nKshatriyas, many Vaisyas, and many Sudras also, came to Dhritarashtra's\\n\\nmansion, with gratified hearts. The old king, coming out of the inner\\n\\napartments, beheld them all, as also his subjects assembled together.\\n\\nBeholding all those assembled citizens and inhabitants of the provinces,\\n\\nand his well-wishers also thus gathered together, and the large number of\\n\\nBrahmanas arrived from diverge realms, king Dhritarashtra of great\\n\\nintelligence, O monarch, said these words,--'Ye all and the Kurus have\\n\\nlived together for many long years, well-wishers of each other, and each\\n\\ntherefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nYudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.--Do thou command, O\\n\\nmonarch, what gifts should be made to these. All things are ready\\n\\nhere.--As soon as the king spoke, they gave away what he directed.[30]\\n\\nUnto him that was to receive a hundred, a thousand was given, and unto\\n\\nhim that was to receive a thousand was given ten thousand, at the command\\n\\nof the royal son of Kunti.[31] Like the, clouds vivifying the crops with\\n\\ntheir downpours, that royal cloud gratified the Brahmanas by downpours of\\n\\nwealth. After all those gifts had been distributed, the king, O thou of\\n\\ngreat intelligence, then deluged the assembled guests of all the four\\n\\norders with repeated surges of food and drink of diverge tastes. Verily,\\n\\nthe Dhritarashtra-ocean, swelling high, with jewels and gems for its\\n\\nwaters, rich with the villages and fields and other foremost of gifts\\n\\nconstituting its verdant islands, heaps of diverse kinds of precious\\n\\nservices which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\\n\\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\\n\\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\\n\\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\\n\\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\\n\\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\\n\\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\\n\\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\\n\\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\\n\\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\\n\\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\\n\\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\\n\\nalleged against thee and thy son. Regarding what thou hast said about\\n\\nDuryodhana in the matter of this carnage of kinsmen, I beg thee, O\\n\\ndelighter of the Kurus (to listen to me).'\\n\\n\\\"The Brahmana continued, 'The destruction that has overtaken the Kurus\\n\\nwas not brought about by Duryodhana. It was not brought about by thee.\\n\\nNor was it brought about by Karna and Suvala's son. We know that it was\\n\\nbrought about by destiny, and that it was incapable of being\\n\\ncounteracted. Verily, destiny is not capable of being resisted by human\\n\\nexertion. Eight and ten Akshauhinis of troops, O monarch, were brought\\n\\ntogether. In eight and ten days that host was destroyed by the foremost\\n\\nof Kuru warriors, viz., Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and others, and the\\n\\nhigh-souled Karna, and the heroic Yuyudhana, and Dhrishtadyumna, and by\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\nSECTION XXIX\\n\\n(Putradarsana Parva)\\n\\n\\\"Janamejaya said, 'Tell me. O learned Brahmana, what that wonderful feat\\n\\nwas which the great Rishi Vyasa of high energy accomplished after his\\n\\npromise to the old king, made when Dhritarashtra, that lord of Earth,\\n\\nthat foremost one of Kuru's race, had taken up his abode in the forest,\\n\\nwith his wife and with his daughter-in-law Kunti; and after, indeed,\\n\\nVidura had left his own body and entered into Yudhishthira, and at the\\n\\ntime when all the sons of Pandu were staying in the ascetic retreat. For\\n\\nhow many days did the Kuru king Yudhishthira of unfading glory stay, with\\n\\nhis men, in the woods? On what food, O puissant one, did the high-souled\\n\\nPandavas support themselves, with their men, and wives, while they lived\\n\\nin the woods? O sinless one, do thou tell me this.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nKettle-drums struck by nobody, produced their music deep as the roar of\\n\\nthe cloud. A loud uproar was heard in the welkin consisting of the\\n\\nwords--Excellent, Excellent! The mighty-armed Dhananjaya, rising up and\\n\\nwell-comforted, embraced Vabhruvahana and smelled his head. He saw\\n\\nsitting at a distance from his son, this latter's mother afflicted with\\n\\ngrief, in the company of Ulupi. Dhananjaya asked,--'Why is it that every\\n\\nthing in the field of battle seems to bear the indications of grief,\\n\\nwonder, and joy? If, O slayer of foes, the cause is known to thee, do\\n\\nthou then tell me. Why has thy mother come to the field of battle? Why\\n\\nalso has Ulupi, the daughter of the prince of snakes, come here?

Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nand every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\nversed in dialectical disputations. When the time came for erecting the\\n\\nsacrificial stake, O chief of Bharata's race, six stakes were set up that\\n\\nwere made of Vilwa,[209] six that were made of Khadira, and six that were\\n\\nmade of Saravarnin. Two stakes were get up by the priests that were made\\n\\nof Devadaru in that sacrifice of the Kuru king, and one that was made of\\n\\nSleshmataka. At the command of the king, Bhima caused some other stakes\\n\\nto be set up, for the sake of beauty only, that were made of gold.\\n\\nAdorned with fine cloths supplied by the royal sage, those stakes shone\\n\\nthere like Indra and the deities with the seven celestial Rishis standing\\n\\naround them in Heaven. A number of golden bricks were made for\\n\\nconstructing therewith a Chayana. The Chayana made resembled in beauty\\n\\nthat which had been made for Daksha, the lord of creatures (on the\\n\\noccasion of his great sacrifice). The Chayana measured eight and ten\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\\n\\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\\n\\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\\n\\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\\n\\nYudhishthira and the father of Duryodhana. When the Kuru king recollected\\n\\nhis wicked son, he then could not but feel unfriendly, in his heart,\\n\\ntowards Bhima. Bhimasena also, O king, impelled by a heart that seemed to\\n\\nbe wicked, was unable to put up with king Dhritarashtra. Vrikodara\\n\\nsecretly did many acts that were disagreeable to the old king. Through\\n\\ndeceitful servitors he caused the commands of his uncle to be disobeyed.\\n\\nRecollecting the evil counsels of the old king and some acts of his,\\n\\nBhima, one day, in the midst of his friends, slapped his armpits, in the\\n\\nhearing of Dhritarashtra and of Gandhari. The wrathful Vrikodara,\\n\\nrecollecting his foes Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana, gave way to a\\n\\ntransport of passion, and said these harsh words: 'The sons of the blind\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical\\n\\ntherefore, O puissant one, take my share of the barley. My body,\\n\\nlife-breaths, and religious rites have all one purpose viz., the service\\n\\nof my senior. Through thy grace, O learned Brahmana, I shall obtain many\\n\\nregions of happiness hereafter. I deserve to be looked after by thee.\\n\\nKnow, O regenerate one, that I am wholly devoted to thee. Cherishing also\\n\\nthis thought, viz., that my happiness is thy concern, it behoveth thee to\\n\\ntake this my share of the barley.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O chaste lady, in consequence of such conduct\\n\\nof thine thou wilt for ever shine in glory, for endued with vows and\\n\\nsteadiness in religious rites, thy eyes are directed to that conduct\\n\\nwhich should be observed towards seniors. Therefore, O daughter-in-law, I\\n\\nshall take thy share of the barley. Thou deservest not to be deceived by\\n\\nme, reckoning all thy virtues. Thou art truly, O blessed damsel, the\\n\\nforemost of all persons observing the duties of righteousness.' Having\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\narrangements of the sacrifice informed king Yudhishthira of it. Hearing\\n\\nthat everything was ready, king Yudhishthira the just, full of alertness\\n\\nand attention, became highly glad along with his brothers all of whom\\n\\nhonoured him duly.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the great sacrifice of Yudhishthira\\n\\ncommenced, many eloquent dialecticians started diverse propositions and\\n\\ndisputed thereon, desirous of vanquishing one another.[203] The (invited)\\n\\nkings beheld the excellent preparations of that sacrifice, resembling\\n\\nthose of the chief himself of the deities, made, O Bharata, by Bhimasena.\\n\\nThey beheld many triumphal arches made of gold, and many beds and seats\\n\\nand other articles of enjoyment and luxury, and crowds of men collected\\n\\nat different sports. There were also many jars and vessels and cauldrons\\n\\nand jugs and lids and covers. The invited kings saw nothing there that\\n\\nwas not made of gold. Many sacrificial stakes also were set up, made,\\n\\nservices which a son renders to his sire. I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I have not the least dissatisfaction with thee, O mighty-armed one.\\n\\nGo now, O son, without tarrying here any longer. Meeting with thee, my\\n\\npenances are being slackened. This my body, endued with penances, I have\\n\\nbeen able to sustain only in consequence of my meeting with thee.[59]\\n\\nThese two mothers of thine, subsisting now upon fallen leaves of trees,\\n\\nand observing vows similar to mine, will not live long. Duryodhana and\\n\\nothers, who have become denizens of the other world, have been seen by\\n\\nus, through the puissance of Vyasa's penances and through (the merit of)\\n\\nthis my meeting with thee. O sinless one, the purpose of my life has been\\n\\nattained. I now wish to set myself to the practice of the austerest of\\n\\npenances. It behoveth thee to grant me permission. On thee now the\\n\\nobsequial cake, the fame and achievements, and the race of our ancestors,\\n\\nas the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip with such a glorious source of learning management principles. 3. MANAGEMENT LESSONS FROM MAHABHARATA The teachings from this great epic help us to understand the following management principles\\u2014 3.1 Scientific Skills and Technology From the ancient period of Mahabharata, technology and skill is being used by the Indians. The palace made by the Kauravas for the destruction of Pandavas was made of wax, which is highly inflammable material. It was not apparent from the outlook of the palace that it was made of wax. Even, in the palace of Pandavas, illusions were created to confuse the outsiders for the purpose of the safety of their palace. The weapons used in the war were very scientific. The modern technology used by the big business houses is based on these ancient scientific skills and\\n\\ncomes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context. If you do not change your decision making instinct with the context, prepare for a storm, prepare for the \\u201cMahabharata\\u201d.\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\\n\\ngreat happiness in that forest. Towards the close of that period, O\\n\\nsinless one, Vyasa came there. While all those princes sat around Vyasa,\\n\\nengaged in conversation on diverse subjects, other Rishis came to that\\n\\nspot. They were Narada, and Parvata and Devala of austere penances, and\\n\\nViswavasu and Tumvuru, and Chitrasena., O Bharata. Endued with severe\\n\\npenances, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, with the permission of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, worshipped them according to due rites. Having obtained\\n\\nthat worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats\\n\\n(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock\\n\\nfeathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\\n\\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\\n\\nHorse-sacrifice. No other king will be able to accomplish what the Kuru\\n\\nking accomplished on that occasion after the manner of Marutta. Accepting\\n\\nthat wealth, the Island-born sage, Krishna, of great learning, gave it\\n\\nunto the sacrificial priests, dividing it into four parts. Having paid\\n\\nthat wealth as the price of the Earth, Yudhishthira, cleansed of his sins\\n\\nand assured of Heaven rejoiced with his brothers. The sacrificial\\n\\npriests, having got that unlimited quantity of wealth, distributed it\\n\\namong the Brahmanas gladly and according to the desire of each recipient.\\n\\nThe Brahmanas also divided amongst themselves, agreeably to\\n\\nYudhishthira's permission, the diverse ornaments of gold that were in the\\n\\nsacrificial compound, including the triumphal arches, the stakes, the\\n\\njars, and diverse kinds of vessels. After the Brahmanas had taken as much\\n\\nas they desired, the wealth that remained was taken away by Kshatriyas\"]}": {
