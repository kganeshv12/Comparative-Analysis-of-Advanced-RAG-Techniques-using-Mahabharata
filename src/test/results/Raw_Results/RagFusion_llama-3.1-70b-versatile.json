There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nArjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.\\n\\nEquipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake\\n\\npenetrating on an anthill. Piercing the son of Kunti through, the shaft\\n\\nwent deep into the Earth. Feeling acute pain, the intelligent Dhananjaya\\n\\nrested awhile, supporting himself on his excellent bow. He stood, having\\n\\nrecourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like\\n\\none deprived of life. That foremost of men, then regaining consciousness,\\n\\npraised his son highly. Possessed of great splendour, the son of Sakra\\n\\nsaid, 'Excellent, Excellent, O mighty-armed one, O son of Chitrangada! O\\n\\nson, beholding this feat, so worthy of thee, I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I shall now shoot these arrows at thee, O son. Stand for fight\\n\\n(without running away).' Having said these words, that slayer of foes\\n\\nshot a shower of arrows on the prince. King Vabhruvahana, however, with\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nequipped agreeably to the ordinances of the treatises (on war-elephants).\\n\\nIrresistible in battle, it had become so infuriate as to be beyond\\n\\ncontrol. Urged on by the prince with the iron-hook, that mighty elephant\\n\\nthen seemed (as it advanced) as if it would cut through the welkin (like\\n\\na flying hill). Beholding it advance towards him, O king, Dhananjaya,\\n\\nfilled with rage and standing on the earth, O Bharata, encountered the\\n\\nprince on its back. Filled with wrath, Vajradatta quickly sped at Arjuna\\n\\na number of broad-headed shafts endued with the energy of fire and\\n\\nresembling (as they coursed through the air) a cloud of speedily-moving\\n\\nlocusts. Arjuna, however, with shafts sped from Gandiva, cut off those\\n\\narrows, some into two and some into three pieces. He cut them off in the\\n\\nwelkin itself with those shafts of his coursing through the welkin. The\\n\\nson of Bhagadatta, beholding his broad-headed shafts thus cut off,\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\ntoo, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of\\n\\nKurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals\\n\\nendued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the\\n\\nson of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\\n\\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\\n\\ncame to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those\\n\\nbattles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal\\n\\nones among all he fought.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\\n\\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\\n\\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\\n\\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\nintelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded\\n\\nArjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the\\n\\nTrigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in\\n\\nscorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the\\n\\nclatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then\\n\\nSuryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya\\n\\nwith hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who\\n\\nfollowed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction\\n\\nof Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\\n\\nSaindhavas who were all fierce in battle, these words:--'I say what is\\n\\nfor your benefit. Though staying before me. I do not wish to slay you. He\\n\\namongst you who will say unto me that he has been vanquished by me and\\n\\nthat he is mine, will be spared by me. Having heard these words of mine,\\n\\nact towards me in that way which may best conduce to your benefit. By\\n\\nacting in a different way you will place yourselves in a situation of\\n\\ngreat fear and danger.' Having said these words unto those heroic\\n\\nwarriors the chief of the Kurus began to fight them. Arjuna was inflamed\\n\\nwith wrath. His foes, desirous of victory, were equally enraged. The\\n\\nSaindhavas then, O king, shot hundreds and thousands of straight arrows\\n\\nat the wielder of Gandiva. Dhananjaya, with his own whetted shafts, cut\\n\\noff those arrows of sharp and terrible points, resembling snakes of\\n\\nvirulent poison, before they could come up to him.

Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\ncomes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context. If you do not change your decision making instinct with the context, prepare for a storm, prepare for the \\u201cMahabharata\\u201d.\\n\\nappeased. Beholding him ungratified, the Brahmana in the observance of\\n\\nthe Unccha vow became thoughtful. His son then said unto him, 'O best of\\n\\nmen, taking my share of the barely do thou give it to the guest. I regard\\n\\nthis act of mine as one of great merit. Therefore, do it. Thou shouldst\\n\\nbe always maintained by me with great care. Maintenance of the father is\\n\\na duty which the good always covet. The maintenance of the father in his\\n\\nold age is the duty ordained for the son. Even this is the eternal sruti\\n\\n(audition) current in the three worlds, O learned Rishi. By barely living\\n\\nthou art capable of practising penances. The life-breath is the great\\n\\ndeity that resides in the bodies of all embodied creatures.'[217]\\n\\n\\\"The father, at this, said, 'If thou attainest to the age of even a\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\nlike a skeleton covered with skin, Dharma's son Yudhishthira shed tears\\n\\nof grief and once more said these words. 'O foremost of men, I do not\\n\\ndesire life and the Earth. O scorcher of foes, I shall employ myself in\\n\\ndoing what is agreeable to thee. If I deserve thy favour, if I am dear to\\n\\nthee, do thou eat something. I shall then know what to do.' Endued with\\n\\ngreat energy, Dhritarashtra then said to Yudhishthira,--'I wish, O son,\\n\\nto take some food, with thy permission.' When Dhritarashtra said these\\n\\nwords to Yudhishthira, Satyavati's son Vyasa came there and said as\\n\\nfollows.`\\n\\nSECTION IV\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, do without any scruple what\\n\\nDhritarashtra of Kuru's race hag said. This king is old. He has, again,\\n\\nbeen made sonless. I think he will not be able to bear his grief long.\\n\\nThe highly blessed Gandhari, possessed of great wisdom and endued with\\n\\nkindly speech, bears with fortitude her excessive grief owing to the logs\\n\\nhe can never marry because of his vow of Brahmacharya.

I know you cannot be killed because of your vardaan of Ichyamrityu but I will take birth time and time again and will be the reason of your death.\\u201d So what do we have here? An impossible situation of killing Bheesma by a woman who does not know how to hold a bow. This woman, however is determined to kill Bheesma. Her determination is as strong as a rock and she did become the reason of Bheesma\\u2019s death on the 10th day of Kurukhshetra battle. She was reborn as Shikhandi \\u2013 half woman/half man. Bheesma would never fire a weapon towards a woman and Arjuna utilized this weakness (Achilees heel of Bheesma) Inference: Work hard and you will succeed and overcome any situation, no matter how difficult it is. Focus on the entire thing, listen carefully before you act \\u2013 Drona In the battle of Kurukshetra, Drona is an unstoppable warrior.\\n\\nobservance of Kshatriya duties.' Having said these words, the old king\\n\\nthen addressed Yudhishthira in particular and said, 'Blessed be thou, O\\n\\nson of the princess of Yadu's race. Listen now to what I say. Cherished\\n\\nby thee, O son, I have lived these years very happily. I have (with thy\\n\\nhelp) made large gifts and performed Sraddhas repeatedly.[3] I have, O\\n\\nson, to the best of my power, achieved merit largely. This Gandhari,\\n\\nthough destitute of sons, has lived with great fortitude, looking all the\\n\\nwhile at me. They whom inflicted great wrongs on Draupadi and robbed thee\\n\\nof thy affluence,--those cruel wights--have all left the world, slain in\\n\\nbattle agreeably to the practice of their order.\\n\\nI have nothing to do for them, O delighter of the Kurus. Stain with their\\n\\nfaces towards battle, they have attained to those regions which are for\\n\\nwielders of weapons.[4] I should now accomplish what is beneficial and\\n\\n\\\"Then Yudhishthira once more summoned all his subjects. The royal sage informed them of his intentions. The citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, hearing the kings words, became filled with anxiety and disapproved of them. This should never be done, said they unto the king. The monarch, well versed with the changes brought about by time, did not listen to their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the people to sanction his views. He then set his heart on leaving the world. His brothers also formed the same resolution. Then Dharmas son, Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, casting off his ornaments, wore barks of trees. Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, and Draupadi also of great fame, similarly clad themselves in bark of trees, O king. Having caused the preliminary rites of religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost of men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding the\\n\\n(King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nmy father. Thou art our king, and thou art our preceptor. The son should,\\n\\nagreeably to every duty, be obedient to the commands of his sire.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the king. Vyasa, that\\n\\nforemost of poets, foremost of all persons conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nendued with great energy once more said unto Yudhishthira these words,\\n\\n'It is even so, O mighty-armed one. It is even as thou sayest, O Bharata.\\n\\nThis king has reached old age. He is now in the last stage of life.\\n\\nPermitted both by me and thee, let this lord of Earth do what he\\n\\nproposes. Do not stand as an impediment in his way. Even this is the\\n\\nhighest duty, O Yudhishthira, of royal sages. They should die either in\\n\\nbattle or in the woods agreeably to the scriptures. Thy royal sire,\\n\\nPandu, O king of kings, reverenced this old king as a disciple reverences\\n\\nhis preceptor.

This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical\\n\\nand every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king.

You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\"]}": {

It has been heard by us that when the old\\n\\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\\n\\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\\n\\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nproceeded to a spot on the margin of Ganga. He then bathed in the sacred\\n\\nstream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.\\n\\nThe wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to\\n\\nburn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt\\n\\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\\n\\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\\n\\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\\n\\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\\n\\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,\\n\\nexceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the\\n\\nconflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,\\n\\nthat foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,--'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a\\n\\nplace where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\\n\\nVaishampayana said, \\\"King Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pritha, had not stayed there for more than a moment when, O thou of Kurus race, all the gods with Indra at their head came to that spot. The deity of Righteousness in his embodied form also came to that place where the Kuru king was, for seeing that monarch. Upon the advent of those deities of resplendent bodies and sanctified and noble deeds, the darkness that had overwhelmed that region immediately disappeared. The torments undergone by beings of sinful deeds were no longer seen. The river Vaitarani, the thorny Salmali, the iron jars, and the boulders of rock, so terrible to behold, also vanished from sight. The diverse repulsive corpses also, which the Kuru king had seen, disappeared at the same time. Then a breeze, delicious and fraught with pleasant perfumes, perfectly pure and delightfully cool, O Bharata, began to blow on that spot in consequence of the presence of the gods. The Maruts, with Indra, the Vasus with the\\n\\nking was also ignited. Sitting near his own fire, he poured libations on\\n\\nit according to due rites, and then worshipped the thousand-rayed sun as\\n\\nhe was on the point of setting. Then Vidura and Sanjaya made a bed for\\n\\nthe king by spreading some blades of Kusa grass. Near the bed of that\\n\\nKuru hero they made another for Gandhari. In close proximity to Gandhari,\\n\\nYudhishthira's mother Kunti, observant of excellent vows, happily laid\\n\\nherself down. Within hearing distance of those three, slept Vidura and\\n\\nothers. The Yajaka Brahmanas and other followers of the king laid\\n\\nthemselves down on their respective beds. The foremost of Brahmanas that\\n\\nwere there chanted aloud many sacred hymns. The sacrificial fires blazed\\n\\nforth all around. That night, therefore, seemed as delightful to them as\\n\\na Brahmi night.[37] When the night passed away, they all arose from their\\n\\nbeds and went through their morning acts. Pouring libations then on the\\n\\nthe mountains of Himavat. Even thus the high-souled Kuru king met with\\n\\nhis death, and it was even thus that Gandhari and Kunti, thy two mothers,\\n\\nalso met with death, O monarch. In course of my wanderings at will, I saw\\n\\nthe bodies of that king and those two queens, O Bharata. Many ascetics\\n\\ncame to that retreat, having heard of the end of king Dhritarashtra. They\\n\\ndid not at all grieve for that end of theirs. There, O best of men, I\\n\\nheard all the details of how the king and the two queens, O son of Pandu,\\n\\nhad been burnt. O king of kings, thou shouldst not grieve for him. The\\n\\nmonarch, of his own will, as also Gandhari and thy mother, obtained that\\n\\ncontact with fire.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued,--'Hearing of the exit of Dhritarashtra from this\\n\\nworld, the high-souled Pandavas all gave way to great grief. Loud sounds\\n\\nor wailing were heard within the inner apartments of the palace. The\\n\\ncitizens also, hearing of the end of the old king, uttered loud\\n\\na Brahmi night.[37] When the night passed away, they all arose from their\\n\\nbeds and went through their morning acts. Pouring libations then on the\\n\\nsacred fire, they continued their journey. Their first day's experience\\n\\nof the forest proved very painful to them on account of the grieving\\n\\ninhabitants of both the city and the provinces of the Kuru kingdom.\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XIX\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'Following the advice of Vidura, the king took up his\\n\\nabode on the banks of the Bhagirathi which were sacred and deserved to be\\n\\npeopled with the righteous. There many Brahmanas who had taken up their\\n\\nabode in the woods, as also many Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, came\\n\\nto see the old monarch. Sitting in their midst, he gladdened them all by\\n\\nhis words. Having duly worshipped the Brahmanas with their disciples, he\\n\\ndismissed them all. As evening came, the king, and Gandhari of great\\n\\nfame, both descended into the stream of the Bhagirathi and duly performed\\n\\npleased, at the command of Dhritarashtra. He beheld many sacrificial\\n\\naltars with sacred fires blazing on them and with many ascetics seated on\\n\\nthem, that had performed their oblations and poured libations in honour\\n\\nof the deities. Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the\\n\\nforest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled\\n\\nupwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics\\n\\npossessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many\\n\\nthat belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or\\n\\nresting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also\\n\\nwere there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole\\n\\nforest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and\\n\\nKokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with\\n\\nthe chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas. Some were adorned\"]}": {

Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt.

O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee.

By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nanother in that fearful melee. Indeed, O king, whoever amongst them took\\n\\nup in wrath a few blades of the Eraka grass, these, in his hands, became\\n\\nsoon converted into a thunderbolt, O puissant one. Every blade of grass\\n\\nthere was seen to be converted into a terrible iron bolt. All this, know,\\n\\nO king, was due to the curse denounced by Brahmanas. He who hurled a\\n\\nblade of grass saw that it pierced through even such things as were\\n\\nutterly impenetrable. In fact, every blade was seen to become a terrible\\n\\nbolt having the force of thunder. Son killed sire, and sire killed son, O\\n\\nBharata. Inebriated with wine, they rushed and fell upon one another. The\\n\\nKukuras and the Andhakas met with destruction like insects rushing at a\\n\\nblazing fire. As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them\\n\\nthought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had\\n\\ncome, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything. Indeed,\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\n1\\n\\nOm! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word \\\"Jaya\\\" be uttered.\\n\\nJanamejaya said: \\\"Having heard of that encounter with iron bolts between the heroes of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races, and having been informed also of Krishnas ascension to Heaven, what did the Pandavas do?\\\"\\n\\nVaishampayana said: \\\"Having heard the particulars of the great slaughter of the Vrishnis, the Kaurava king set his heart on leaving the world. He addressed Arjuna, saying, O thou of great intelligence, it is Time that cooks every creature (in his cauldron). I think that what has happened is due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all). It behoveth thee also to see it.\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\none should manufacture wines and intoxicating spirits of any kind, and\\n\\nthat whoever would secretly manufacture wines and spirits should be\\n\\nimpaled alive with all his kinsmen. Through fear of the king, and knowing\\n\\nthat it was the command of Rama also of unimpeachable deeds, all the\\n\\ncitizens bound themselves by a rule and abstained from manufacturing\\n\\nwines and spirits.\\\"\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n2\\n\\nVaishampayana said: \\\"While the Vrishnis and the Andhakas were thus\\n\\nendeavouring (to avoid the impending calamity), the embodied form of Time\\n\\n(death) every day wandered about their houses. He looked like a man of\\n\\nterrible and fierce aspect. Of bald head, he was black and of tawny\\n\\ncomplexion. Sometimes he was seen by the Vrishnis as he peered into their\\n\\nhouses. The mighty bowmen among the Vrishnis shot hundreds and thousands\\n\\nof shafts at him, but none of these succeeded in piercing him, for he was\\n\\nnone else than the Destroyer of all creatures. Day by day strong winds\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nalleged against thee and thy son. Regarding what thou hast said about\\n\\nDuryodhana in the matter of this carnage of kinsmen, I beg thee, O\\n\\ndelighter of the Kurus (to listen to me).'\\n\\n\\\"The Brahmana continued, 'The destruction that has overtaken the Kurus\\n\\nwas not brought about by Duryodhana. It was not brought about by thee.\\n\\nNor was it brought about by Karna and Suvala's son. We know that it was\\n\\nbrought about by destiny, and that it was incapable of being\\n\\ncounteracted. Verily, destiny is not capable of being resisted by human\\n\\nexertion. Eight and ten Akshauhinis of troops, O monarch, were brought\\n\\ntogether. In eight and ten days that host was destroyed by the foremost\\n\\nof Kuru warriors, viz., Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and others, and the\\n\\nhigh-souled Karna, and the heroic Yuyudhana, and Dhrishtadyumna, and by\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata.

Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization.

The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this?

Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nexcellent and well-decked horses, and with quivers on their backs, they\\n\\nsurrounded that horse, O king, and endeavoured to capture it. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, reflecting on that endeavour of theirs, forbade\\n\\nthose heroes, with conciliatory speeches, O chastiser of foes.\\n\\nDisregarding Arjuna's message, they assailed him with their shafts. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna resisted those warriors who were under the sway of\\n\\ndarkness and passion. Jishnu, addressed them smilingly and said, 'Desist,\\n\\nye unrighteous ones.

He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors.

Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson.

He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nof Krishna, given by Agni, made of iron and having its nave composed of\\n\\nhardest adamant, ascended into the firmament. In the very sight of\\n\\nDaruka, the excellent car of Vasudeva, of solar effulgence, and properly\\n\\nequipped, was taken away by the horses yoked unto it. Those foremost of\\n\\nsteeds, numbering four, (Saivya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Valahaka), and\\n\\nendued with the speed of thought, fled away, dragging the car after them\\n\\nalong the surface of the ocean. The two great standards of Krishnas car\\n\\nand Valadevas car, that with the device of Garuda and that bearing the\\n\\ndevice of the palmyra, which were reverently worshipped by those two\\n\\nheroes, were taken away by Apsaras who, day and night, called upon the\\n\\nVrishnis and the Andhakas to set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred\\n\\nwater. When these omens were seen and heard, those foremost of men, the\\n\\nmighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, became desirous of\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\na wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw away the head unknowingly and head broke into pieces. In this way strategic management by Krishna saved Arjuna 3.10 Situational Management Mahabharata also teaches us situational management. Krishna a well renowned crisis manager tried to administer the situation many times in Mahabharata. One of the incident is illustrated here. Arjuna was saved from serpant weapon used by Karna to kill him through situational management technique opted by Krishna. Krishna pushed the chariot down in to the earth by one foot at the last moment. Due to pushing down of chariot, the serpant arrow hit the crown of Arjuna and fell on the earth without causing any harm to Arjuna. In this way situational management by Krishna saved Arjuna\\u2019s life. 3.11 Importance of Quality over Quantity Effective Management requires\"]}": {

The son of Pandu, for\\n\\ngratifying his sister Dussala, established her infant grandson in his\\n\\npaternal kingdom.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nviz., the Pandavas of wide chests. They said, 'We wish to know who\\n\\namongst these is Yudhishthira, who are Bhima and Arjuna, who the twins,\\n\\nand who is Draupadi of great fame.' Then the Suta, Sanjaya, in answer to\\n\\ntheir queries, pointed out to them the Pandavas. naming each, and\\n\\nDraupadi too as also the other ladies of the Kuru household.'\\n\\n\\\"Sanjaya said, 'This one that is as fair of complexion as pure gold, that\\n\\nis endued with a body which looks like that of a full-grown lion, that is\\n\\npossessed of a large aquiline nose, and wide and expansive eyes that are,\\n\\nagain, of a coppery hue, is the Kuru king. This one, whose tread\\n\\nresembles that of an infuriate elephant, whose complexion is as fair as\\n\\nthat of heated gold, whose frame is of large and expansive proportions\\n\\nand whose arms are long and stout, is Vrikodara. Behold him well! The\\n\\nmighty bowman who sits besides him, of darkish complexion and youthful\\n\\nframe, who resembles the leader of an elephantine herd, whose shoulders\\n\\nluminary of the night. Here is the mighty bowman Pandu, now united with Kunti and Madri. Thy sire frequently comes to me on his excellent car. Behold the royal Bhishma, the son of Santanu, now in the midst of the Vasus. Know that this one by the side of Brihaspati is thy preceptor Drona. These and other kings, O son of Pandu, who had warred on thy side now walk with the Gandharvas or Yakshas or other sacred beings. Some have attained to the status of Guhyakas, O king. Having cast off their bodies, they have conquered Heaven by the merit they had acquired through word, thought and deed.\"]}": {

Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nInference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently. Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\ncontinuous practice. They focused on their goals. It was regular practice, dedication and commitment of Arjuna which made him powerful during war and he defeated great warriors of Kauravas. After the loss of their kingdom, Pandavas tried to work on their weaknesses and learned new skills. Arjuna utilized the time during their exile to acquire new weapons. Yudhishthra acquired teachings from various Rishis and learned the game of dice. Business promoters must experience their products and plans in order to survive in long run. They need to concentrate on continuous improvement for the success of business. 3.15 Women empowerment Women empowerment means participation of women in decision making. Participation of women in decision making helps to view the situation in holistic way. Harmonious, feminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed\\n\\n(King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nmighty bowman who sits besides him, of darkish complexion and youthful\\n\\nframe, who resembles the leader of an elephantine herd, whose shoulders\\n\\nare as high as those of a lion, who walks like a sporting elephant, and\\n\\nwhose eyes are as expansive as the petals of a lotus, is the hero called\\n\\nArjuna. Those two foremost of men, that are sitting besides Kunti, are\\n\\nthe twins, resembling Vishnu and Mahendra. In this whole world of men,\\n\\nthey have not their equals in beauty and strength and excellence of\\n\\nconduct. This lady, of eyes as expansive as lotus petals, who seems to\\n\\nhave touched the middle age of life, whose complexion resembles that of\\n\\nthe blue lotus, and who looks like a goddess of Heaven, is Krishna, the\\n\\nembodied form of the goddess of prosperity.[39] She who sits besides her,\\n\\npossessed of the complexion of pure gold, who looks like the embodied\\n\\nrays of the moon, in the midst of the other ladies, is, ye foremost of\\n\\nLessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nwere checked in battle,--heroes that were equal to Indra himself in\\n\\nmight--why would not he ascend to Heaven? O irresistible one, do thou\\n\\nkill this grief of thine. Do not suffer thyself to be swayed by wrath.\\n\\nThat conqueror of hostile cities has attained in that sanctified goal\\n\\nwhich depends upon death at the edge of weapons. After the fall of that\\n\\nhero, this my sister Subhadra stricken with grief, indulged in loud\\n\\nlamentations, when she saw Kunti, like a female ospray. When she met\\n\\nDraupadi, she asked her in grief,--O reverend lady, where are all our\\n\\nsons? I desire to behold them. Hearing her lamentations, all the Kaurava\\n\\nladies embraced her and wept sitting around her. Beholding (her\\n\\ndaughter-in-law) Uttara, she said,--'O blessed girl, where has thy\\n\\nhusband gone? When he comes back, do thou, without losing a moment,\\n\\napprise me of it. Alas, O daughter of Virata, as soon he heard my voice,\\n\\nhe used to come out of his chamber without the loss of a moment. Why does\\n\\nthese words.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XVII\\n\\n\\\"Kunti said, 'It is even so, O mighty-armed son of Pandu, as thou sayest.\\n\\nYe kings, formerly when ye were cheerless, it was even in this way that I\\n\\nexcited you all. Yes, seeing that your kingdom was wrested from you by a\\n\\nmatch at dice, seeing that you all fell from happiness, seeing that you\\n\\nwere domineered over by kinsmen, I instilled courage and high thoughts\\n\\ninto your minds. Ye foremost of men, I encouraged you in order that they\\n\\nthat were the sons of Pandu might not be lost, in order that their fame\\n\\nmight not be lost. You are all equal to Indra. Your prowess resembles\\n\\nthat of the very gods. In order that you might not live, watching the\\n\\nfaces of others, I acted in that way.[34] I instilled courage into thy\\n\\nheart in order that thou who art the foremost of all righteous persons,\\n\\nwho art equal to Vasava, might not again go into the woods and live in\\n\\nmisery. I instilled courage into your hearts in order that this Bhima who\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\"]}": {

Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure.

For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nSudras of his realm. Whatever wrongs were done to him by the sons of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, king Yudhishthira, forgot them all, and reverenced his\\n\\nuncle. If any man did anything that was not agreeable to the son of\\n\\nAmvika, he became thereby an object of hatred to the intelligent son of\\n\\nKunti. Indeed, through fear of Yudhishthira, nobody could talk of the\\n\\nevil deeds of either Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra. Both Gandhari and\\n\\nVidura also wore well pleased with the capacity the king Ajatasatru\\n\\nshowed for bearing wrongs. They were, however, not so pleased, O slayer\\n\\nof foes, with Bhima. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, was truly obedient to\\n\\nhis uncle. Bhima, however, at the sight of Dhritarashtra, became very\\n\\ncheerless. That slayer of foes, seeing Dharma's son reverencing the old\\n\\nking, reverenced him outwardly with a very unwilling heart.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\\n\\nInference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently. Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\nas before. Kunti, and Draupadi, and she of the Sattwata race, possessed\\n\\nof great fame, and Ulupi, the daughter of the snake chief, and queen\\n\\nChitrangada, and the sister of Dhrishtaketu, and the daughter of\\n\\nJarasandha,--these and many other ladies, O chief of men, used to wait\\n\\nupon the daughter of Suvala like maids of all work. That Dhritarashtra,\\n\\nwho was deprived of all his children, might not feel unhappy in any\\n\\nmatter, was what Yudhishthira often said unto his brothers to see. They\\n\\nalso, on their part, listening to these commands of grave import from\\n\\nking Yudhishthira, showed particular obedience to the old king. There was\\n\\none exception, however. It embraced Bhimasena. All that had followed from\\n\\nthat match at dice which had been brought about by the wicked\\n\\nday. Thus addressed by Arjuna, the royal son of Bhagadatta, defeated by\\n\\nthe son of Pandu, said,--'So be it.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXVII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'There occurred a great battle between the\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna and the hundreds of Saindhavas who still lived after\\n\\nthe slaughter of their clan (on the field of Kurukshetra). Hearing that\\n\\nhe of white steeds had entered their territories, those Kshatriyas came\\n\\nout against him, unable to bear that foremost one of Pandu's race. Those\\n\\nwarriors who were as terrible as virulent poison, finding the horse\\n\\nwithin their dominion, seized it without being inspired with any fear of\\n\\nPartha who was the younger brother of Bhimasena. Advancing against\\n\\nVibhatsu who waited on foot, armed with his bow, upon the sacrificial\\n\\nsteed, they assailed him from a near point.

Indeed, O king, the several volumes of this treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated mind.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"The Mahabharata, an ancient Indian epic, features a diverse array of female characters who play pivotal roles in shaping the narrative. This analysis will focus on the roles of Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari, examining how their actions and choices drive the narrative and reflect the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma.\\n\\nDraupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, is a complex and multifaceted character. Her actions and choices significantly impact the narrative, often serving as a catalyst for key events. Draupadi's polyandrous marriage to the Pandavas, for instance, is a pivotal aspect of the epic. Her rejection of Karna, who possessed all the qualities she desired in a husband, and her subsequent marriage to the Pandavas, sets the stage for the epic's exploration of themes such as dharma, loyalty, and the complexities of human relationships.\\n\\nDraupadi's character also reflects the epic's views on gender and power. As a strong-willed and independent woman, she challenges the patriarchal norms of ancient Indian society. Her famous disrobing incident, where she is publicly humiliated by the Kauravas, serves as a powerful commentary on the objectification and exploitation of women. However, Draupadi's subsequent actions, including her vow to tie her hair only when she has washed it in the blood of her tormentors, demonstrate her agency and determination to reclaim her dignity.\\n\\nKunti, the mother of the Pandavas, is another significant female character in the Mahabharata. Her actions and choices are often driven by her maternal instincts and her desire to protect her sons. Kunti's decision to reveal the truth about Karna's parentage, for instance, is a crucial moment in the epic, as it highlights the complexities of family relationships and the consequences of keeping secrets.\\n\\nKunti's character also reflects the epic's views on dharma and the role of women in upholding it. As a matriarchal figure, Kunti is often depicted as a source of wisdom and guidance for her sons. Her famous advice to Yudhishthira, \\\"Do not grieve, for this is the way of the world,\\\" serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of accepting one's fate and fulfilling one's duties.\\n\\nGandhari, the wife of Dhritarashtra and the mother of the Kauravas, is a complex and nuanced character. Her actions and choices are often driven by her loyalty to her family and her desire to protect them. Gandhari's decision to blindfold herself, for instance, is a powerful symbol of her devotion to her husband and her willingness to share his suffering.\\n\\nGandhari's character also reflects the epic's views on the consequences of blind loyalty and the importance of moral responsibility. Her failure to intervene in the Kauravas' evil plans, despite her knowledge of their wrongdoing, serves as a commentary on the dangers of complicity and the importance of speaking truth to power.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the roles of Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari in the Mahabharata are multifaceted and complex, reflecting the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma. Their actions and choices drive the narrative, often serving as catalysts for key events and themes. Through their characters, the Mahabharata offers a nuanced exploration of the human experience, highlighting the complexities and challenges of living a virtuous life in a world filled with moral ambiguity.\\n\\nThe epic's portrayal of women also reflects the societal norms and values of ancient India. While the Mahabharata often challenges patriarchal norms, it also reinforces certain stereotypes and expectations surrounding women's roles in society. However, the complexity and nuance of the female characters in the epic serve as a powerful reminder of the importance of women's agency and autonomy in shaping their own lives and destinies.\\n\\nUltimately, the Mahabharata's portrayal of women serves as a powerful commentary on the human condition, highlighting the complexities and challenges of living a virtuous life in a world filled with moral ambiguity. Through the characters of Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari, the epic offers a nuanced exploration of the human experience, one that continues to resonate with readers and audiences today.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Examine the role of women in the Mahabharata, focusing on Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari.

Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee.

Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No\\n\\nLessons of Management from Mahabharata \\u2013 Human values and indian Ethos Skip to content Increase Font Size 1. Learning Outcomes 2.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nrisen from sleep. Kunti also shall behold Karna, and she of Yadu's race\\n\\nshall behold her son Abhimanyu. Draupadi shall behold her five sons, her\\n\\nsires, and her brothers also. Even before ye had asked me, this was the\\n\\nthought in my mind. I entertained this purpose when I was urged to that\\n\\neffect by the king, by thee, O Gandhari, and by Kunti. Thou shouldst not\\n\\ngrieve for those foremost of men. They met with death in consequence of\\n\\ntheir devotion to the established practices of Kshatriyas. O faultless\\n\\none, the work of the gods could not but be accomplished. It was for\\n\\naccomplishing that object that those heroes came down on Earth. They were\\n\\nall portions of the deities. Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Pisachas and\\n\\nGuhyakas and Rakshasas, many persons of great sanctity, many individuals\\n\\n(King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nKarna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and she uses it to create jealously among the cousins time and again. Apart from Duryodhana, many men lusted for her. This provoked the disrobing incident to a grat extent. Inference: Do not ask for things you can\\u2019t handle, lower your standards. Also, dont be besotted by your beauty and looks, for they are likely to go against you. Beware of the company you keep \\u2013 Shakuni Young Duryodhana is not as arrogant. But he is slowly spoiled by Gandhar prince, Shakuni. Shakuni slowly fills Duryodhana\\u2019s heart with bitterness and exploits him. Duryodhana is an unmellowed clay, he is provoked to be raged against Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the\\n\\nBehold, the two sons of Madri are overwhelmed with sorrow and grief.\\n\\nRelent, O mother, O thou of great fame, do not go into the woods now. Do\\n\\nthou enjoy that prosperity which acquired by might, has become\\n\\nYudhishthira's today.' Firmly resolved to retire into the woods, Kunti\\n\\ndisregarded these lamentations of her sons. Then Draupadi with a\\n\\ncheerless face, accompanied by Subhadra, followed her weeping\\n\\nmother-in-law who was journeying on from desire of going into the woods.\\n\\nPossessed of great wisdom and firmly resolved on retirement from the\\n\\nworld, the blessed dame walked on, frequently looking at her weeping\\n\\nchildren.

While both characters are skilled warriors and share some similarities, their differences in background, personality, and choices contribute to distinct narrative arcs that illuminate the complexities of human nature.\\n\\n**Similarities:**\\n\\n1. **Exceptional archery skills**: Both Karna and Arjuna are renowned for their expertise in archery, which makes them formidable opponents on the battlefield.\\n2. **Noble spirit**: Both characters possess a noble spirit, demonstrated by their courage, loyalty, and adherence to their personal codes of conduct.\\n3. **Respect from others**: Both Karna and Arjuna earn the respect of their peers and enemies alike, with Karna being acknowledged as a noble spirit by Krishna and Bheesma, and Arjuna being revered as a great warrior by his friends and foes.\\n\\n**Differences:**\\n\\n1. **Background**: Karna is the illegitimate son of Kunti, raised by a charioteer, while Arjuna is the third son of Pandu, raised as a prince.\\n2. **Personality**: Karna is often depicted as hot-headed and impulsive, while Arjuna is more introspective and thoughtful.\\n3. **Choices**: Karna chooses to side with the Kauravas, despite knowing they are in the wrong, due to his loyalty to Duryodhana, who has given him a sense of identity and belonging. Arjuna, on the other hand, chooses to fight for the Pandavas, despite his reservations about killing his cousins, due to his duty to his family and the just cause.\\n4. **Mentorship**: Karna is largely self-taught, while Arjuna has the guidance of Krishna, who serves as his mentor and friend.\\n\\n**Parallel journeys:**\\n\\n1. **Struggle with identity**: Both Karna and Arjuna grapple with their identities and sense of belonging. Karna struggles with his illegitimate birth and his desire for recognition, while Arjuna struggles with his role as a warrior and his duty to his family.\\n2. **Confronting morality**: Both characters are forced to confront the moral complexities of war and the consequences of their actions. Karna is torn between his loyalty to Duryodhana and his knowledge of the Kauravas' wrongdoing, while Arjuna is torn between his duty to his family and his reluctance to kill his cousins.\\n3. **Redemption and growth**: Both characters undergo significant growth and redemption throughout the epic. Karna ultimately finds redemption in his bravery and loyalty, despite fighting for the wrong side, while Arjuna finds redemption in his willingness to confront his doubts and fears, and to fight for the just cause.\\n\\n**Contributions to the epic's themes:**\\n\\n1. **The complexity of human nature**: The parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna highlight the complexity of human nature, demonstrating that individuals can possess both noble and flawed qualities.\\n2. **The importance of mentorship**: The contrast between Karna's self-taught nature and Arjuna's mentorship under Krishna emphasizes the importance of guidance and mentorship in personal growth and development.\\n3. **The struggle with identity and belonging**: The struggles of Karna and Arjuna with their identities and sense of belonging serve as a powerful reminder of the human need for connection and belonging.\\n4. **The power of redemption and growth**: The redemption and growth of both characters demonstrate the possibility of personal transformation and the importance of confronting one's flaws and weaknesses.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna serve as a rich tapestry for exploring the complexities of human nature, the importance of mentorship, and the power of redemption and growth.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization.

Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nexcellent and well-decked horses, and with quivers on their backs, they\\n\\nsurrounded that horse, O king, and endeavoured to capture it. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, reflecting on that endeavour of theirs, forbade\\n\\nthose heroes, with conciliatory speeches, O chastiser of foes.\\n\\nDisregarding Arjuna's message, they assailed him with their shafts. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna resisted those warriors who were under the sway of\\n\\ndarkness and passion. Jishnu, addressed them smilingly and said, 'Desist,\\n\\nye unrighteous ones. Life is a benefit (that should not be thrown away).'\\n\\nAt the time of his setting out, he had been earnestly ordered by king\\n\\nYudhishthira the just, not to slay those Kshatriyas whose kinsmen had\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\ntoo, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of\\n\\nKurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals\\n\\nendued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the\\n\\nson of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\\n\\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\\n\\ncame to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those\\n\\nbattles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal\\n\\nones among all he fought.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\\n\\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\\n\\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\\n\\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\\n\\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\\n\\n\\\"Though thus addressed by Narada, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, endued with great intelligence, enquired about his brothers and said, If these eternal regions reserved for heroes be Duryodhanas, that unrighteous and sinful wight, that man who was the destroyer of friends and of the whole world, that man for whose sake the entire Earth was devastated with all her horses and elephants and human beings, that wight for whose sake we were burnt with wrath in thinking of how best we might remedy our wrongs, I desire to see what regions have been attained by those high-souled heroes, my brothers of high vows, steady achievers of promises, truthful in speech, and distinguished for courage. The high-souled Karna, the son of Kunti, incapable of being baffled in battle, Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, the sons of Dhrishtadyumna and those other Kshatriyas who met with death in the observance of Kshatriya practices, where are those lords of Earth, O Brahmana? I do not see them here, O Narada. I desire to\"]}": {

This demonstrates the importance of putting duty and responsibility above personal desires.\\n2. **Conflict between duty and desire**: Bhishma's vow creates a conflict between his duty to his father and his own personal desires. This internal conflict highlights the tension between fulfilling one's obligations and pursuing one's own interests.\\n3. **Consequences of rigid adherence to duty**: Bhishma's rigid adherence to his vow ultimately leads to negative consequences, such as the kingdom being left without a king and the birth of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, who go on to play key roles in the epic's conflicts. This suggests that an overemphasis on duty can lead to unforeseen and undesirable outcomes.\\n4. **Importance of flexibility and adaptability**: The Mahabharata suggests that duty and personal desire are not mutually exclusive, and that flexibility and adaptability are essential in navigating complex situations. Bhishma's inflexibility in the face of changing circumstances ultimately proves to be a limitation.\\n5. **The role of personal desire in shaping duty**: Bhishma's vow is motivated by his desire to please his father, highlighting the role of personal desire in shaping one's sense of duty. This underscores the idea that duty is not always a fixed or absolute concept, but can be influenced by personal motivations and emotions.\\n\\nOverall, Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness serve as a nuanced exploration of the complex relationship between duty and personal desire in the Mahabharata.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"Lessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life.

So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nSudras of his realm. Whatever wrongs were done to him by the sons of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, king Yudhishthira, forgot them all, and reverenced his\\n\\nuncle. If any man did anything that was not agreeable to the son of\\n\\nAmvika, he became thereby an object of hatred to the intelligent son of\\n\\nKunti. Indeed, through fear of Yudhishthira, nobody could talk of the\\n\\nevil deeds of either Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra. Both Gandhari and\\n\\nVidura also wore well pleased with the capacity the king Ajatasatru\\n\\nshowed for bearing wrongs. They were, however, not so pleased, O slayer\\n\\nof foes, with Bhima. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, was truly obedient to\\n\\nhis uncle. Bhima, however, at the sight of Dhritarashtra, became very\\n\\ncheerless. That slayer of foes, seeing Dharma's son reverencing the old\\n\\nking, reverenced him outwardly with a very unwilling heart.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\\n\\neach equal in point of merit to sacrifice.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XCI\\n\\n\\\"Janamejaya said, 'O puissant Rishi, kings are attached to sacrifices.\\n\\nThe great Rishis are attached to penances.

Formerly, on one\\n\\noccasion Sakra performed a particular sacrifice. While the limbs of the\\n\\nsacrifice were spread out, the Ritwijas became busy in accomplishing the\\n\\ndiverse rites ordained in the scriptures. The pourer of libations,\\n\\npossessed of every qualification, became engaged in pouring libations of\\n\\nclarified butter. The great Rishis were seated around.

The citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, hearing the kings words, became filled with anxiety and disapproved of them. This should never be done, said they unto the king. The monarch, well versed with the changes brought about by time, did not listen to their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the people to sanction his views. He then set his heart on leaving the world. His brothers also formed the same resolution. Then Dharmas son, Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, casting off his ornaments, wore barks of trees. Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, and Draupadi also of great fame, similarly clad themselves in bark of trees, O king. Having caused the preliminary rites of religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost of men cast off their sacred fires into the water.

Let\\n\\nall the wealth that occurs in the three worlds come here today of its own\\n\\naccord. Let all the tribes of celestial Apsaras, all the Gandharvas along\\n\\nwith the Kinnaras, and Viswavasu, and others there are (of that order),\\n\\napproach this sacrifice of mine. Let all the wealth that exists among the\\n\\nNorthern Kurus, come of their own accord to these sacrifices.

The Rishis who were there beheld the power of penances with\\n\\nrejoicing hearts. Filled with wonder they then said these words of grave\\n\\nimport.'\\n\\n\\\"I have thus, O chief of men, told everything in thy presence. He that listens with devotion to this Bharata from the beginning becomes cleansed of every sin even if he be guilty of Brahmanicide or the violation of his preceptors bed, or even if he be a drinker of alcohol or a robber of other peoples wares, or even if he be born in the Chandala order.

In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making.

A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nproceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world). When the time again comes, it will come back into his hands. This foremost of bows, Gandiva, was procured by me from Varuna for the use of Partha. Let it be made over to Varuna himself.\\n\\ntoo, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of\\n\\nKurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals\\n\\nendued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the\\n\\nson of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\\n\\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\\n\\ncame to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those\\n\\nbattles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal\\n\\nones among all he fought.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\\n\\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\\n\\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\\n\\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\nking's eyes. Large gifts were made to the messenger for the very\\n\\nagreeable tidings he had brought. On the second day from that date, a\\n\\nloud din was heard when that foremost of men, that chief of the Kurus,\\n\\ncame. The dust raised by the hoofs of that horse as it walked in close\\n\\nadjacence to Arjuna, looked as beautiful as that raised by the celestial\\n\\nsteed Uchchaisravas. And as Arjuna advanced he heard many gladdening\\n\\nwords uttered by the citizens. 'By good luck, O Partha, thou art out of\\n\\ndanger. Praise to you and king Yudhishthira! Who else than Arjuna could\\n\\ncome back after having caused the horse to wander over the whole Earth\\n\\nand after having vanquished all the kings in battle? We have not heard of\\n\\nsuch a feat having been achieved by even Sagara and other high-souled\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\noff those arrows of sharp and terrible points, resembling snakes of\\n\\nvirulent poison, before they could come up to him. Having cut off those\\n\\nsharp arrows equipt with Kanka feathers, Arjuna pierced each of the\\n\\nwarriors opposed to him with a whetted shaft. The Saindhava Kshatriyas,\\n\\nrecollecting that it was Dhananjaya who had slain their king Jayadratha,\\n\\nthen hurled at him darts and javelins with great force. The diadem-decked\\n\\nDhananjaya of great might baffled their intent by cutting off all those\\n\\nweapons before any of them could reach him. At length the son of Pandu\\n\\nbecame highly angry. With many straight and broad-headed arrows, he\\n\\nfelled the heads of many of those warriors who were rushing at him from\\n\\ndesire of victory. Many fled, many rushed at Arjuna; many moved not, all\\n\\nof them, however, uttered such aloud noise (of wrath and grief) that it\\n\\nresembled the roar of the ocean. As they were slain by Partha of\\n\\n\\\"Bhishma of mighty energy and great effulgence attained to the status of the Vasus. Eight Vasus, O chief of Bharatas race, are now seen. Drona entered into Brihaspati, that foremost one of Angirasas descendants. Hridikas son Kritavarma entered the Maruts. Pradyumna entered Sanatkumara whence he had issued. Dhritarashtra obtained the regions, so difficult of acquisition, that belong to the Lord of treasures. The famous Gandhari obtained the same regions with her husband Dhritarashtra. With his two wives, Pandu proceeded to the abode of the great Indra. Both Virata and Drupada, the king Dhrishtaketu, as also Nishatha, Akrura, Samva, Bhanukampa, and Viduratha, and Bhurishrava and Sala and king Bhuri, and Kansa, and Ugrasena, and Vasudeva, and Uttara, that foremost of men, with his brother Sankhaall these foremost of persons entered the deities. Somas son of great prowess, named Varchas of mighty energy, became Abhimanyu, the son of Phalguna, that lion among men. Having fought, agreeably\\n\\n1\\n\\nOm! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word \\\"Jaya\\\" be uttered.\\n\\nJanamejaya said: \\\"Having heard of that encounter with iron bolts between the heroes of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races, and having been informed also of Krishnas ascension to Heaven, what did the Pandavas do?\\\"\\n\\nVaishampayana said: \\\"Having heard the particulars of the great slaughter of the Vrishnis, the Kaurava king set his heart on leaving the world.

The son of Surya, thy eldest brother, the foremost of men, even this one was known as the son of Radha. He moves in the company of Surya. Behold this foremost of Beings. Among the tribes of the Saddhyas, the gods, the Viswedevas, and the Maruts, behold, O king of kings, the mighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, viz., those heroes having Satyaki for their first, and those mighty ones among the Bhojas. Behold the son of Subhadra, invincible in battle, now staying with Soma. Even he is the mighty bowman Abhimanyu, now endued with the gentle effulgence of the great luminary of the night. Here is the mighty bowman Pandu, now united with Kunti and Madri. Thy sire frequently comes to me on his excellent car. Behold the royal Bhishma, the son of Santanu, now in the\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt.

O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava force\\n\\n\\\"Bhishma of mighty energy and great effulgence attained to the status of the Vasus. Eight Vasus, O chief of Bharatas race, are now seen. Drona entered into Brihaspati, that foremost one of Angirasas descendants. Hridikas son Kritavarma entered the Maruts. Pradyumna entered Sanatkumara whence he had issued. Dhritarashtra obtained the regions, so difficult of acquisition, that belong to the Lord of treasures. The famous Gandhari obtained the same regions with her husband Dhritarashtra. With his two wives, Pandu proceeded to the abode of the great Indra. Both Virata and Drupada, the king Dhrishtaketu, as also Nishatha, Akrura, Samva, Bhanukampa, and Viduratha, and Bhurishrava and Sala and king Bhuri, and Kansa, and Ugrasena, and Vasudeva, and Uttara, that foremost of men, with his brother Sankhaall these foremost of persons entered the deities.

Having fought, agreeably\\n\\n\\\"Thus addressed by his brother, the son of Kunti only repeated the word Time, Time! and fully endorsed the view of his eldest brother gifted with great intelligence. Ascertaining the resolution of Arjuna, Bhimasena and the twins fully endorsed the words that Arjuna had said. Resolved to retire from the world for earning merit, they brought Yuyutsu before them. Yudhishthira made over the kingdom to the son of his uncle by his Vaisya wife. Installing Parikshit also on their throne, as king, the eldest brother of the Pandavas, filled with sorrow, addressed Subhadra, saying, This son of thy son will be the king of the Kurus. The survivor of the Yadus, Vajra, has been made a king. Parikshit will rule in Hastinapura, while the Yadava prince, Vajra, will rule in Shakraprastha. He should be protected by thee. Never set thy heart on unrighteousness.\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him.

There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nthe celestials in the midst of the denizens of Heaven. The sons of Pandu,\\n\\nsurrounded by the assembled kings, looked as beautiful, O king, as the\\n\\nplanets in the midst of the stars. Unto those kings they made presents of\\n\\nvarious jewels and gems, and elephants and horses and ornaments of gold,\\n\\nand female slaves and cloths and large measures of gold. Indeed, Pritha's\\n\\nson by distributing that untold wealth among the invited monarchs, shone,\\n\\nO king, like Vaisravana, the lord of treasures. Summoning next the heroic\\n\\nking Vabhruvahana, Yudhishthira gave unto him diverse kinds of wealth in\\n\\nprofusion and gave him permission to return home. The son of Pandu, for\\n\\ngratifying his sister Dussala, established her infant grandson in his\\n\\npaternal kingdom. The Kuru king Yudhishthira, having a full control over\\n\\nhis senses, then dismissed the assembled kings all of whom had been\\n\\nproperly classed and honoured by him.[212] The illustrious son of Pandu,\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nentirely filled. The Pandavas, with rejoicing hearts, accompanied by\\n\\ntheir officers and friends entered the capital, placing that treasure in\\n\\ntheir van. Repairing, agreeably to custom, to king Dhritarashtra first,\\n\\nthey worshipped his feet, announcing their respective names. Those\\n\\nforemost ones of Bharata's race, O chief of kings, then paid their\\n\\nrespectful salutations to Gandhari, the daughter of Suvala and to Kunti,\\n\\nThey next worshipped (their uncle) Vidura and met Yuyutsu, the son of\\n\\nDhritarashtra by his Vaisya wife. Those heroes were then worshipped by\\n\\nothers and they blazed forth in beauty, O king. After this, O Bharata,\\n\\nthose heroes heard the tidings of that highly wonderful and marvellous\\n\\nand glad-some birth of thy father. Hearing of that feat of Vasudeva of\\n\\ngreat intelligence, they all worshipped Krishna, the delighter of Devaki,\\n\\nwho was every way worthy of worship. Then, after a few days, Vyasa, the\\n\\nall portions of the deities. Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Pisachas and\\n\\nGuhyakas and Rakshasas, many persons of great sanctity, many individuals\\n\\ncrowned with success (of penances), celestial Rishis, deities and Danavas\\n\\nand heavenly Rishis of spotless character, met with death on the\\n\\nbattle-field of Kurukshetra.[49] It is heard that he that was the\\n\\nintelligent king of the Gandharvas, and named Dhritarashtra, took birth\\n\\nin the world of men as thy lord Dhritarashtra. Know that Pandu of\\n\\nunfading glory and distinguished above all others, sprung from the\\n\\nMaruts. Kshattri and Yudhishthira are both portions of the deity of\\n\\nRighteousness. Know that Duryodhana was Kali, and Sakuni was Dwapara. O\\n\\nthou of good features, know that Dussasana and others were all Rakshasas.\\n\\nBhimasena of great might, that chastiser of foes, is from the Maruts.\\n\\nKnow that this Dhananjaya, the son of Pritha, is the ancient Rishi Nara.\\n\\nHrishikesa is Narayana, and the twins are the Aswins. The foremost of\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n6\\n\\nJanamejaya said, \\\"O holy one, according to what rites should the learned listen to the Bharata? What are the fruits (acquirable by hearing it)? What deities are to be worshipped during the several paranas? What should be the gifts that one should make, O holy one, at every parva or sacred day (during the continuance of the recitation)? What should be the qualification of the reciter to be engaged? Tell me all this!\\n\\nRejoicing greatly, Krishna made gifts unto the child of many valuable\\n\\ngems. The other chiefs of the Vrishni race, did the same. Then the\\n\\npuissant Janarddana, firmly adhering to truth, bestowed a name on the\\n\\ninfant who was thy sire, O monarch.--'Since this child of Abhimanyu has\\n\\nbeen born at a time when this race has become nearly extinct, let his\\n\\nname be Parikshit!' Even this is what he said. Then thy father, O king,\\n\\nbegan to grow, and gladden all the people, O Bharata. When thy father was\\n\\na month old, O hero, the Pandavas came back to their capital, bringing\\n\\nwith them a profusion of wealth. Hearing that the Pandavas were near,\\n\\nthose foremost ones of the Vrishni race went out. The citizens decked the\\n\\ncity called after the elephant with garlands of flowers in profusions,\\n\\nwith beautiful pennons and standards of diverse kinds. The citizens also,\\n\\nO king, adorned their respective mansions. Desirous of doing what was\\n\\nviz., the Pandavas of wide chests. They said, 'We wish to know who\\n\\namongst these is Yudhishthira, who are Bhima and Arjuna, who the twins,\\n\\nand who is Draupadi of great fame.' Then the Suta, Sanjaya, in answer to\\n\\ntheir queries, pointed out to them the Pandavas. naming each, and\\n\\nDraupadi too as also the other ladies of the Kuru household.'\\n\\n\\\"Sanjaya said, 'This one that is as fair of complexion as pure gold, that\\n\\nis endued with a body which looks like that of a full-grown lion, that is\\n\\npossessed of a large aquiline nose, and wide and expansive eyes that are,\\n\\nagain, of a coppery hue, is the Kuru king. This one, whose tread\\n\\nresembles that of an infuriate elephant, whose complexion is as fair as\\n\\nthat of heated gold, whose frame is of large and expansive proportions\\n\\nand whose arms are long and stout, is Vrikodara. Behold him well! The\\n\\nmighty bowman who sits besides him, of darkish complexion and youthful\\n\\nframe, who resembles the leader of an elephantine herd, whose shoulders\\n\\nas before. I can even repeatedly create a different order of things. Let\\n\\ngold and whatever else of wealth there is, come to this place today. Let\\n\\nall the wealth that occurs in the three worlds come here today of its own\\n\\naccord. Let all the tribes of celestial Apsaras, all the Gandharvas along\\n\\nwith the Kinnaras, and Viswavasu, and others there are (of that order),\\n\\napproach this sacrifice of mine. Let all the wealth that exists among the\\n\\nNorthern Kurus, come of their own accord to these sacrifices. Let Heaven,\\n\\nand all those who have Heaven for their home, and Dharma himself, come\\n\\nhither.'--After the ascetic had uttered these words, everything happened\\n\\nas he wished, in consequence of his penances, for Agastya was endued with\\n\\na mind that resembled a blazing fire and was possessed of extraordinary\\n\\nenergy. The Rishis who were there beheld the power of penances with\\n\\nrejoicing hearts.

The omens and portents that appear before the destruction of the Yadavas, such as the drying up of the river Saraswati and the disappearance of the constellation of the birth stars, signify the role of Time in bringing about their downfall.\\n2. **The fall of the Kauravas**: In the Bhishma Parva, Time is depicted as the destroyer of the Kauravas. The war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas is seen as a manifestation of Time's destructive power, leading to the downfall of the Kauravas and the end of their dynasty.\\n3. **The death of Kunti**: In the Ashramavasika Parva, Time is shown as the destroyer of Kunti, who, despite being the mother of the Pandavas, is unable to escape the ravages of Time. Her death serves as a reminder of the inevitability of Time's destructive power.\\n\\n**Time as a Preserver:**\\n\\n1. **The preservation of the Pandavas**: In the Adi Parva, Time is depicted as the preserver of the Pandavas. The birth of the Pandavas, despite the obstacles and challenges they face, is seen as a manifestation of Time's preservative power.\\n2. **The guidance of Lord Krishna**: Throughout the epic, Lord Krishna is shown to be the embodiment of Time's preservative power. His guidance and counsel help the Pandavas navigate the challenges they face, ultimately leading to their victory and the preservation of their kingdom.\\n3. **The cyclical nature of Time**: In the Anushasana Parva, Time is described as a cyclical force, with events repeating themselves over time. This cyclical nature of Time is seen as a preservative force, allowing for the continuation of life and the universe.\\n\\n**Examples of Time's dual nature:**\\n\\n1. **The story of Gandhari**: Gandhari's story serves as an example of Time's dual nature. On one hand, Time is depicted as the destroyer of her sons and her dynasty. On the other hand, Time is also shown to be the preserver of her legacy, as her curse ultimately leads to the downfall of the Kauravas and the rise of the Pandavas.\\n2. **The character of Karna**: Karna's story is another example of Time's dual nature. Time is depicted as the destroyer of Karna's life and his chances of becoming a great hero. However, Time is also shown to be the preserver of Karna's legacy, as his story serves as a reminder of the importance of loyalty and duty.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of Time (Kala) is portrayed as both a destroyer and preserver throughout the Mahabharata.

Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder.

Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson.

The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No\\n\\n1\\n\\nOm! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word \\\"Jaya\\\" be uttered.\\n\\nJanamejaya said: \\\"Having heard of that encounter with iron bolts between the heroes of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races, and having been informed also of Krishnas ascension to Heaven, what did the Pandavas do?\\\"\\n\\nVaishampayana said: \\\"Having heard the particulars of the great slaughter of the Vrishnis, the Kaurava king set his heart on leaving the world.

I think that what has happened is due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all). It behoveth thee also to see it.\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nmade the fifteenth by Rahu once more. Such a day had happened at the time\\n\\nof the great battle of the Bharatas. It has once more appeared, it seems,\\n\\nfor our destruction. \\\"The slayer of Keshi, Janardana, thinking upon the\\n\\nomens that Time showed, understood that the thirty-sixth year had come,\\n\\nand that what Gandhari, burning with grief on account of the death of her\\n\\nsons, and deprived of all her kinsmen, had said was about to transpire.\\n\\nThe present is exactly similar to that time when Yudhishthira noted at\\n\\nsuch awful omens when the two armies had been arrayed in order of battle.\\n\\nVasudeva, having said so, endeavoured to bring about those occurrences\\n\\nwhich would make Gandharis words true. That chastiser of foes commanded\\n\\nthe Vrishnis to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water. The messengers\\n\\nbare ground through the acts of my sinful self. I do not grieve for the\\n\\nfamous Gandhari who had been deprived of all her children. Observing the\\n\\nsame vows as her husband, she has attained to those very regions which\\n\\nhave become his. I grieve, however, for Pritha who, abandoning the\\n\\nblazing prosperity of her sons, became desirous of residing in the woods.\\n\\nFie on this sovereignty of ours, fie on our prowess, fie on the practices\\n\\nof Kshatriyas! Though alive, we are really dead! O foremost of superior\\n\\nBrahmanas, the course of Time is very subtle and difficult to understand,\\n\\ninasmuch as Kunti, abandoning sovereignty, became desirous of taking up\\n\\nher abode in the forest. How is it that she who was the mother of\\n\\nYudhishthira, of Bhima, of Vijaya, was burnt to deathlike a helpless\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nas the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip with such a glorious source of learning management principles. 3. MANAGEMENT LESSONS FROM MAHABHARATA The teachings from this great epic help us to understand the following management principles\\u2014 3.1 Scientific Skills and Technology From the ancient period of Mahabharata, technology and skill is being used by the Indians. The palace made by the Kauravas for the destruction of Pandavas was made of wax, which is highly inflammable material. It was not apparent from the outlook of the palace that it was made of wax. Even, in the palace of Pandavas, illusions were created to confuse the outsiders for the purpose of the safety of their palace. The weapons used in the war were very scientific. The modern technology used by the big business houses is based on these ancient scientific skills and\\n\\n1\\n\\nOm! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as\\n\\nalso to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word \\\"Jaya\\\" be uttered.\\n\\nVaishampayana said: \\\"When the thirty-sixth year (after the battle) was\\n\\nreached, the delighter of the Kurus, Yudhishthira, beheld many unusual\\n\\nportents. Winds, dry and strong, and showering gravels, blew from every\\n\\nside. Birds began to wheel, making circles from right to left. The great\\n\\nrivers ran in opposite directions. The horizon on every side seemed to be\\n\\nalways covered with fog. Meteors, showering (blazing) coals, fell on the\\n\\nEarth from the sky. The Suns disc, O king, seemed to be always covered\\n\\nwith dust. At its rise, the great luminary of day was shorn of splendour\\n\\nand seemed to be crossed by headless trunks (of human beings). Fierce\\n\\ncircles of light were seen every day around both the Sun and the Moon.\\n\\nThese circles showed three hues. Their edges seemed to be black and rough\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru.

Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nfor the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\ndeep affliction. The servants of the Vrishnis, their horsemen, and their\\n\\ncar-warriors too, followed the procession. The citizens and the\\n\\ninhabitants of the country, at the command of Prithas son, set out at the\\n\\nsame time and proceeded, surrounding that cavalcade destitute of heroes\\n\\nand numbering only women and the aged and the children. The warriors who\\n\\nfought from the backs of elephants proceeded on elephants as huge as\\n\\nhills. The foot-soldiers also set out, together with the reserves. The\\n\\nchildren of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, all followed Arjuna. The\\n\\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out,\\n\\nkeeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudevas harem, and\\n\\nVajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna. The widows of the other\\n\\nheroes of the Bhoja, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races, lordless now,\\n\\nthat set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions. That foremost of\\n\\ncar-warriors, that conqueror of hostile towns, the son of Pritha,\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him. O puissant\\n\\none, I know that the hunger of children is very strong. I am old. I shall\\n\\nsomehow succeed in holding my life-breaths. Do thou, O son, become strong\\n\\n(by eating the food that has fallen to thy share). Old and decrepit as I\\n\\nam, O son, hunger scarcely afflicts me. I have, again, for many years,\\n\\npractised penances. I have no fear of death.'\\n\\n\\\"The son said, 'I am thy offspring. The Sruti declares that one's\\n\\noffspring is called putra because one is rescued by him. One's own self,\\n\\nagain, takes birth as one's son. Do thou, therefore, rescue thyself by\\n\\nthy own self (in the form of thy son).'\\n\\n\\\"The father said, 'In form thou art like me. In conduct and in\\n\\nself-restraint also thou art my like. Thou hast been examined on various\\n\\noccasions by me. I shall, therefore, accept thy share of the barley, O\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n6\\n\\nJanamejaya said, \\\"O holy one, according to what rites should the learned listen to the Bharata? What are the fruits (acquirable by hearing it)? What deities are to be worshipped during the several paranas? What should be the gifts that one should make, O holy one, at every parva or sacred day (during the continuance of the recitation)? What should be the qualification of the reciter to be engaged? Tell me all this!\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\na wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw away the head unknowingly and head broke into pieces. In this way strategic management by Krishna saved Arjuna 3.10 Situational Management Mahabharata also teaches us situational management. Krishna a well renowned crisis manager tried to administer the situation many times in Mahabharata. One of the incident is illustrated here. Arjuna was saved from serpant weapon used by Karna to kill him through situational management technique opted by Krishna. Krishna pushed the chariot down in to the earth by one foot at the last moment. Due to pushing down of chariot, the serpant arrow hit the crown of Arjuna and fell on the earth without causing any harm to Arjuna. In this way situational management by Krishna saved Arjuna\\u2019s life. 3.11 Importance of Quality over Quantity Effective Management requires\\n\\nas before. I can even repeatedly create a different order of things. Let\\n\\ngold and whatever else of wealth there is, come to this place today. Let\\n\\nall the wealth that occurs in the three worlds come here today of its own\\n\\naccord. Let all the tribes of celestial Apsaras, all the Gandharvas along\\n\\nwith the Kinnaras, and Viswavasu, and others there are (of that order),\\n\\napproach this sacrifice of mine. Let all the wealth that exists among the\\n\\nNorthern Kurus, come of their own accord to these sacrifices. Let Heaven,\\n\\nand all those who have Heaven for their home, and Dharma himself, come\\n\\nhither.'--After the ascetic had uttered these words, everything happened\\n\\nas he wished, in consequence of his penances, for Agastya was endued with\\n\\na mind that resembled a blazing fire and was possessed of extraordinary\\n\\nenergy. The Rishis who were there beheld the power of penances with\\n\\nrejoicing hearts. Filled with wonder they then said these words of grave\\n\\nimport.'\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No\\n\\nforemost of men, viz., king Yudhishthira, said unto the chief of the\\n\\nVrishnis that it was even so. The princess Draupadi, however, looked\\n\\nangrily and askance at Krishna, (for she could not bear the ascription of\\n\\nany fault to Arjuna). The slayer of Kesi, viz., Hrishikesa, approved of\\n\\nthat indication of love (for his friend) which the princess of Panchala,\\n\\nwho also was his friend, displayed.[204] Bhimasena and the other Kurus,\\n\\nincluding the sacrificial priests, who heard of the agreeable triumphs of\\n\\nArjuna in course of his following the horse, became highly gratified.\\n\\nWhile they were still engaged in discoursing on Arjuna, an envoy came\\n\\nfrom that high-souled hero bearing a message from him. Repairing to the\\n\\npresence of the Kuru king, the intelligent envoy bowed his head in\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\"]}": {

Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nuniverse. The sound of lamentations uttered by those weeping heroes,\\n\\nfilling the spacious chambers of the palace, escaped therefrom and\\n\\npenetrated the very welkin.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XXXIX\\n\\n\\\"Narada said, 'The king has not been burnt to death by an unsanctified\\n\\nfire. I have heard this there. I tell thee, O Bharata, such has not been\\n\\nthe fate of Vichitraviryya. It has been heard by us that when the old\\n\\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\\n\\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\\n\\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nproceeded to a spot on the margin of Ganga. He then bathed in the sacred\\n\\nstream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.\\n\\nThe wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to\\n\\nburn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt\\n\\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\\n\\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\\n\\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\\n\\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\\n\\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,\\n\\nexceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the\\n\\nconflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,\\n\\nthat foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,--'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a\\n\\nplace where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall\\n\\ngrace, numerous regions of beatitude will be mine for eternity. Through\\n\\nthe grandson one obtains those regions repairing whither one has not to\\n\\nendure any kind of misery. Like the triple aggregate beginning with\\n\\nReligion, or the triple aggregate of sacred fires, there is a triple\\n\\naggregate of everlasting Heavens, depending upon the son, the grandson,\\n\\nand the great-grandson. The son is called Putra because he frees his\\n\\nsires from debt. Through sons and grandsons one always enjoys the\\n\\nhappiness of those regions which are reserved for the pious and the good.'\\n\\n\\\"The father-in-law said, 'O thou of excellent vows and conduct, beholding\\n\\nthee wasted by wind and sun, deprived of thy very complexion, emaciated\\n\\nand almost destitute of consciousness through hunger, how can I be such a\\n\\ntransgressor against the rules of righteousness as to take thy share of\\n\\nthe barley? O auspicious damsel, it behoves thee not to say so, for the\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\"]}": {
