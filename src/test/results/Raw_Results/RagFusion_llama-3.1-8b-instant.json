The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical\\n\\nthousand coins were placed on the back of each camel; eight thousand on\\n\\neach car; four and twenty thousand on each elephant; (while proportionate\\n\\nloads were placed on horses and mules and on the backs, shoulder and\\n\\nheads of men). Having loaded these vehicles with that wealth and once\\n\\nmore worshipping the great deity Siva, the son of Pandu set out for the\\n\\ncity called after the elephant, with the permission of the Island-born\\n\\nRishi, and placing his priest Dhaumya in the van. That foremost of men,\\n\\nviz., the royal son of Pandu, made short marches everyday, measured by a\\n\\nGoyuta (4 miles). That mighty host, O king, afflicted with the weight\\n\\nthey bore, returned, bearing that wealth, towards the capital, gladdening\\n\\nthe hearts of all those perpetuators of the Kuru race.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXVI\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'Meanwhile, Vasudeva of great energy accompanied by\\n\\nthe Vrishnis, came to the city called after the elephant. While leaving\\n\\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\\n\\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\\n\\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\\n\\njust never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of\\n\\nAmvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great\\n\\nenergy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and\\n\\njuice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as\\n\\nbefore.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse\\n\\nkinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of\\n\\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\\n\\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\nof religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost of men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding the princes in that guise, wept aloud. They seemed to look as they had looked in days before, when with Draupadi forming the sixth in number they set out from the capital after their defeat at dice. The brothers, however, were all very cheerful at the prospect of retirement. Ascertaining the intentions of Yudhishthira and seeing the destruction of the Vrishnis, no other course of action could please them then.\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nthe other ladies of the Kuru race with due formalities. Kunti gave them\\n\\nmany gems and costly things. Draupadi and Subhadra and the other ladies\\n\\nof Kuru's race all made presents to them. The two ladies took up their\\n\\nresidence there, using costly beds and seats, treated with affection and\\n\\nrespect by Kunti herself from desire of doing what was agreeable to\\n\\nPartha. King Vabhruvahana of great energy, duly honoured (by Kunti), then\\n\\nmet Dhritarashtra according to due rites. Repairing then to king\\n\\nYudhishthira and Bhima and the other Pandavas, the mighty prince of\\n\\nManipura saluted them all with humility. They all embraced him with great\\n\\naffection and honoured him duly. And those mighty car-warriors highly\\n\\ngratified with him, made large gifts of wealth unto him. The king of\\n\\nManipura then humbly approached Krishna, that hero armed with the discus\\n\\nand the mace, like a second Pradyumna approaching his sire. Krishna gave\\n\\nHorse-sacrifice. No other king will be able to accomplish what the Kuru\\n\\nking accomplished on that occasion after the manner of Marutta. Accepting\\n\\nthat wealth, the Island-born sage, Krishna, of great learning, gave it\\n\\nunto the sacrificial priests, dividing it into four parts. Having paid\\n\\nthat wealth as the price of the Earth, Yudhishthira, cleansed of his sins\\n\\nand assured of Heaven rejoiced with his brothers. The sacrificial\\n\\npriests, having got that unlimited quantity of wealth, distributed it\\n\\namong the Brahmanas gladly and according to the desire of each recipient.\\n\\nThe Brahmanas also divided amongst themselves, agreeably to\\n\\nYudhishthira's permission, the diverse ornaments of gold that were in the\\n\\nsacrificial compound, including the triumphal arches, the stakes, the\\n\\njars, and diverse kinds of vessels. After the Brahmanas had taken as much\\n\\nas they desired, the wealth that remained was taken away by Kshatriyas\\n\\n\\\"The five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth, and a dog forming the seventh, set out on their journey. Indeed, even thus did king Yudhishthira depart, himself the head of a party of seven, from the city named after the elephant. The citizen and the ladies of the royal household followed them for some distance. None of them, however, could venture to address the king for persuading him to give up his intention. The denizens of the city then returned; Kripa and others stood around Yuyutsu as their centre. Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga chief, O thou of Kuntis race, entered the waters of Ganga. The princess Chitrangada set out for the capital of Manipura. The other ladies who were the grandmothers of Parikshit centered around him. Meanwhile the high-souled Pandavas, O thou of Kurus race, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nday. Thus addressed by Arjuna, the royal son of Bhagadatta, defeated by\\n\\nthe son of Pandu, said,--'So be it.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXVII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'There occurred a great battle between the\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna and the hundreds of Saindhavas who still lived after\\n\\nthe slaughter of their clan (on the field of Kurukshetra). Hearing that\\n\\nhe of white steeds had entered their territories, those Kshatriyas came\\n\\nout against him, unable to bear that foremost one of Pandu's race. Those\\n\\nwarriors who were as terrible as virulent poison, finding the horse\\n\\nwithin their dominion, seized it without being inspired with any fear of\\n\\nPartha who was the younger brother of Bhimasena. Advancing against\\n\\nVibhatsu who waited on foot, armed with his bow, upon the sacrificial\\n\\nsteed, they assailed him from a near point. Defeated in battle before,\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\nBardhamanakas, and innumerable Bhajanas of beautiful forms, were dug out\\n\\nby king Yudhishthira the just. The wealth thus dug out was placed in\\n\\nlarge 'Karaputas' for protection.[182] A portion of the wealth was caused\\n\\nto be borne upon the shoulders of men in stout balances of wood with\\n\\nbaskets slung like scales at both ends. Indeed, O king, there were other\\n\\nmethods of conveyance there for bearing away that wealth of the son of\\n\\nPandu.[183] There were sixty thousands of camels and a hundred and twenty\\n\\nthousand horses, and of elephants, O monarch, there were one hundred\\n\\nthousand. Of cars there were as many, and of carts, too as many, and of\\n\\nshe-elephants as many. Of mules and men the number was untold. That\\n\\nwealth which Yudhishthira caused to be dugout was even so much. Sixteen\\n\\nthousand coins were placed on the back of each camel; eight thousand on\\n\\neach car; four and twenty thousand on each elephant; (while proportionate\\n\\nand every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava force\\n\\nthe celestials in the midst of the denizens of Heaven. The sons of Pandu,\\n\\nsurrounded by the assembled kings, looked as beautiful, O king, as the\\n\\nplanets in the midst of the stars. Unto those kings they made presents of\\n\\nvarious jewels and gems, and elephants and horses and ornaments of gold,\\n\\nand female slaves and cloths and large measures of gold. Indeed, Pritha's\\n\\nson by distributing that untold wealth among the invited monarchs, shone,\\n\\nO king, like Vaisravana, the lord of treasures. Summoning next the heroic\\n\\nking Vabhruvahana, Yudhishthira gave unto him diverse kinds of wealth in\\n\\nprofusion and gave him permission to return home. The son of Pandu, for\\n\\ngratifying his sister Dussala, established her infant grandson in his\\n\\npaternal kingdom. The Kuru king Yudhishthira, having a full control over\\n\\nhis senses, then dismissed the assembled kings all of whom had been\\n\\nproperly classed and honoured by him.[212] The illustrious son of Pandu,\\n\\narrangements of the sacrifice informed king Yudhishthira of it. Hearing\\n\\nthat everything was ready, king Yudhishthira the just, full of alertness\\n\\nand attention, became highly glad along with his brothers all of whom\\n\\nhonoured him duly.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the great sacrifice of Yudhishthira\\n\\ncommenced, many eloquent dialecticians started diverse propositions and\\n\\ndisputed thereon, desirous of vanquishing one another.[203] The (invited)\\n\\nkings beheld the excellent preparations of that sacrifice, resembling\\n\\nthose of the chief himself of the deities, made, O Bharata, by Bhimasena.\\n\\nThey beheld many triumphal arches made of gold, and many beds and seats\\n\\nand other articles of enjoyment and luxury, and crowds of men collected\\n\\nat different sports. There were also many jars and vessels and cauldrons\\n\\nand jugs and lids and covers. The invited kings saw nothing there that\\n\\nwas not made of gold. Many sacrificial stakes also were set up, made,\"]}": {

Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\nfor the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ndeep affliction. The servants of the Vrishnis, their horsemen, and their\\n\\ncar-warriors too, followed the procession. The citizens and the\\n\\ninhabitants of the country, at the command of Prithas son, set out at the\\n\\nsame time and proceeded, surrounding that cavalcade destitute of heroes\\n\\nand numbering only women and the aged and the children. The warriors who\\n\\nfought from the backs of elephants proceeded on elephants as huge as\\n\\nhills. The foot-soldiers also set out, together with the reserves. The\\n\\nchildren of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, all followed Arjuna. The\\n\\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out,\\n\\nkeeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudevas harem, and\\n\\nVajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna. The widows of the other\\n\\nheroes of the Bhoja, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races, lordless now,\\n\\nthat set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions. That foremost of\\n\\ncar-warriors, that conqueror of hostile towns, the son of Pritha,\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nforemost of men, viz., king Yudhishthira, said unto the chief of the\\n\\nVrishnis that it was even so. The princess Draupadi, however, looked\\n\\nangrily and askance at Krishna, (for she could not bear the ascription of\\n\\nany fault to Arjuna). The slayer of Kesi, viz., Hrishikesa, approved of\\n\\nthat indication of love (for his friend) which the princess of Panchala,\\n\\nwho also was his friend, displayed.[204] Bhimasena and the other Kurus,\\n\\nincluding the sacrificial priests, who heard of the agreeable triumphs of\\n\\nArjuna in course of his following the horse, became highly gratified.\\n\\nWhile they were still engaged in discoursing on Arjuna, an envoy came\\n\\nfrom that high-souled hero bearing a message from him. Repairing to the\\n\\npresence of the Kuru king, the intelligent envoy bowed his head in\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter.

Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\ntoo, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of\\n\\nKurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals\\n\\nendued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the\\n\\nson of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\\n\\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\\n\\ncame to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those\\n\\nbattles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal\\n\\nones among all he fought.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\\n\\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\\n\\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\\n\\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nArjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.\\n\\nEquipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake\\n\\npenetrating on an anthill. Piercing the son of Kunti through, the shaft\\n\\nwent deep into the Earth. Feeling acute pain, the intelligent Dhananjaya\\n\\nrested awhile, supporting himself on his excellent bow. He stood, having\\n\\nrecourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like\\n\\none deprived of life. That foremost of men, then regaining consciousness,\\n\\npraised his son highly. Possessed of great splendour, the son of Sakra\\n\\nsaid, 'Excellent, Excellent, O mighty-armed one, O son of Chitrangada! O\\n\\nson, beholding this feat, so worthy of thee, I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I shall now shoot these arrows at thee, O son. Stand for fight\\n\\n(without running away).' Having said these words, that slayer of foes\\n\\nshot a shower of arrows on the prince. King Vabhruvahana, however, with\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nexcellent and well-decked horses, and with quivers on their backs, they\\n\\nsurrounded that horse, O king, and endeavoured to capture it. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, reflecting on that endeavour of theirs, forbade\\n\\nthose heroes, with conciliatory speeches, O chastiser of foes.\\n\\nDisregarding Arjuna's message, they assailed him with their shafts. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna resisted those warriors who were under the sway of\\n\\ndarkness and passion. Jishnu, addressed them smilingly and said, 'Desist,\\n\\nye unrighteous ones. Life is a benefit (that should not be thrown away).'\\n\\nAt the time of his setting out, he had been earnestly ordered by king\\n\\nYudhishthira the just, not to slay those Kshatriyas whose kinsmen had\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\n\\\"Though thus addressed by Narada, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, endued with great intelligence, enquired about his brothers and said, If these eternal regions reserved for heroes be Duryodhanas, that unrighteous and sinful wight, that man who was the destroyer of friends and of the whole world, that man for whose sake the entire Earth was devastated with all her horses and elephants and human beings, that wight for whose sake we were burnt with wrath in thinking of how best we might remedy our wrongs, I desire to see what regions have been attained by those high-souled heroes, my brothers of high vows, steady achievers of promises, truthful in speech, and distinguished for courage. The high-souled Karna, the son of Kunti, incapable of being baffled in battle, Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, the sons of Dhrishtadyumna and those other Kshatriyas who met with death in the observance of Kshatriya practices, where are those lords of Earth, O Brahmana?

        "{\"actual_output\": \"The question posed by Vaisampayana is a complex one, and it requires a nuanced understanding of the Mahabharata's themes and characters.\\n\\nThe theme of duty versus personal desire is a central concern in the Mahabharata. The characters in the story are often faced with difficult choices that pit their duty to others against their personal desires.\\n\\nBheesma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness is a classic example of duty versus personal desire. On one hand, Bheesma's vow is a selfless act that puts the needs of his father and his kingdom above his own desires. He renounces sex and marriage, not because he is motivated by a desire for personal pleasure, but because he believes it is his duty to fulfill his father's happiness.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Bheesma's personal desires are also a factor in his decision. He is deeply devoted to his father and wants to see him happy, and he is willing to sacrifice his own desires for that purpose. This is evident in his decision to renounce sex and marriage, which is a personal sacrifice that he believes is necessary for his father's happiness.\\n\\nThe theme of duty versus personal desire is also reflected in the character of Bhima, who is also deeply devoted to his father and wants to see him happy. However, Bhima's personal desires are also a factor in his decision. He is willing to sacrifice his own desires for the sake of his father and his kingdom, and he is willing to take risks and face challenges in order to fulfill his duty.\\n\\nThe theme of duty versus personal desire is also reflected in the character of Arjuna, who is torn between his duty to fight for his kingdom and his personal desire to avoid conflict. Arjuna's decision to fight is motivated by a sense of duty to his kingdom and his family, but it is also a personal sacrifice that he believes is necessary for his own well-being.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the theme of duty versus personal desire is a central concern in the Mahabharata. The characters in the story are often faced with difficult choices that pit their duty to others against their personal desires. Bheesma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness is a classic example of duty versus personal desire, and it reflects the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata.\\n\\nDecision Making: Context is important\\n\\nThe decision-making process in the Mahabharata is often influenced by the context in which it is made. The characters in the story are often faced with difficult choices that require them to consider the consequences of their actions in different contexts.\\n\\nFor example, Bheesma's decision to renounce sex and marriage is influenced by the context of his father's happiness. If his father is not happy, Bheesma may feel that it is not his duty to fulfill his father's happiness, and he may choose to pursue other options. On the other hand, if his father is happy, Bheesma may feel that it is his duty to fulfill his father's happiness, and he may choose to renounce sex and marriage.\\n\\nSimilarly, Bhima's decision to fight for his kingdom is influenced by the context of the war. If the war is not going well, Bhima may feel that it is not his duty to fight, and he may choose to avoid conflict. On the other hand, if the war is going well, Bhima may feel that it is his duty to fight, and he may choose to take risks and face challenges in order to fulfill his duty.\\n\\nThe decision-making process in the Mahabharata is often influenced by the characters' personal desires and motivations. For example, Arjuna's decision to fight is motivated by a sense of duty to his kingdom and his family, but it is also a personal sacrifice that he believes is necessary for his own well-being.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the decision-making process in the Mahabharata is often influenced by the context in which it is made. The characters in the story are often faced with difficult choices that require them to consider the consequences of their actions in different contexts. Context is an important factor in decision-making, and it can influence the characters' motivations and actions in complex and nuanced ways.\\n\\nWork hard and you will succeed and overcome any situation, no matter how difficult it is.\\n\\nThis is a key message of the Mahabharata, and it is conveyed through the character of Drona, who is an unstoppable warrior. Drona's message is one of perseverance and determination, and it is a message that is conveyed through his actions and his words.\\n\\nDrona's message is also conveyed through his relationship with Vidura and Sanjaya, who are both wise and intelligent characters. Vidura and Sanjaya are both able to see through the flaws in Drona's character and to understand the complexities of his motivations.

But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context.

The royal sage informed them of his intentions. The citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, hearing the kings words, became filled with anxiety and disapproved of them. This should never be done, said they unto the king. The monarch, well versed with the changes brought about by time, did not listen to their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the people to sanction his views. He then set his heart on leaving the world. His brothers also formed the same resolution. Then Dharmas son, Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, casting off his ornaments, wore barks of trees. Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, and Draupadi also of great fame, similarly clad themselves in bark of trees, O king. Having caused the preliminary rites of religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost of men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding the\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nobservance of Kshatriya duties.' Having said these words, the old king\\n\\nthen addressed Yudhishthira in particular and said, 'Blessed be thou, O\\n\\nson of the princess of Yadu's race. Listen now to what I say. Cherished\\n\\nby thee, O son, I have lived these years very happily. I have (with thy\\n\\nhelp) made large gifts and performed Sraddhas repeatedly.[3] I have, O\\n\\nson, to the best of my power, achieved merit largely. This Gandhari,\\n\\nthough destitute of sons, has lived with great fortitude, looking all the\\n\\nwhile at me. They whom inflicted great wrongs on Draupadi and robbed thee\\n\\nof thy affluence,--those cruel wights--have all left the world, slain in\\n\\nbattle agreeably to the practice of their order.\\n\\nI have nothing to do for them, O delighter of the Kurus.

Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure.

For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter.

My desire of life, however, is due to\\n\\nmy wish of acquiring merit and not wealth or enjoyment. Do thou cast\\n\\nauspicious looks upon us all. To obtain thy sight will be difficult for\\n\\nus. The king will commence to practise the most austere and unbearable of\\n\\npenances.' Hearing these words, that lord of battle, the mighty-armed\\n\\nSahadeva, with eyes bathed in tears, addressed Yudhishthira, saying,--'O\\n\\nchief of Bharata's race, I dare not leave my mother. Do thou return to\\n\\nthe capital soon. I shall practise penances, O puissant one.

When the Kuru king recollected\\n\\nhis wicked son, he then could not but feel unfriendly, in his heart,\\n\\ntowards Bhima. Bhimasena also, O king, impelled by a heart that seemed to\\n\\nbe wicked, was unable to put up with king Dhritarashtra. Vrikodara\\n\\nsecretly did many acts that were disagreeable to the old king. Through\\n\\ndeceitful servitors he caused the commands of his uncle to be disobeyed.\\n\\nRecollecting the evil counsels of the old king and some acts of his,\\n\\nBhima, one day, in the midst of his friends, slapped his armpits, in the\\n\\nhearing of Dhritarashtra and of Gandhari. The wrathful Vrikodara,\\n\\nrecollecting his foes Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana, gave way to a\\n\\ntransport of passion, and said these harsh words: 'The sons of the blind\\n\\nappeased. Beholding him ungratified, the Brahmana in the observance of\\n\\nthe Unccha vow became thoughtful.

Thou shouldst\\n\\nbe always maintained by me with great care. Maintenance of the father is\\n\\na duty which the good always covet. The maintenance of the father in his\\n\\nold age is the duty ordained for the son. Even this is the eternal sruti\\n\\n(audition) current in the three worlds, O learned Rishi.

In this\\n\\nway was king Vabhruvahana incited against his sire by his (step) mother.\\n\\nAt last, endued as he was with great energy, he made up his mind, O chief\\n\\nof the Bharata's, to fight Dhananjaya. Putting on his armour of bright\\n\\ngold and his effulgent head-gear, he ascended an excellent car which had\\n\\nhundreds of quivers ready on it. That car was equipt with necessaries for\\n\\nbattle and had steeds yoked to it that were endued with the speed of the\\n\\nmind. It had excellent wheels and a strong Upashkara, and was adorned\\n\\nwith golden ornaments of every kind. Raising his standard which was\\n\\ndecorated most beautifully and which bore the device of a lion in gold,\\n\\nthe handsome prince Vabhruvahana proceeded against his sire for battle.\\n\\nmy father. Thou art our king, and thou art our preceptor. The son should,\\n\\nagreeably to every duty, be obedient to the commands of his sire.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by the king. Vyasa, that\\n\\nforemost of poets, foremost of all persons conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nendued with great energy once more said unto Yudhishthira these words,\\n\\n'It is even so, O mighty-armed one. It is even as thou sayest, O Bharata.\\n\\nThis king has reached old age. He is now in the last stage of life.\\n\\nPermitted both by me and thee, let this lord of Earth do what he\\n\\nproposes. Do not stand as an impediment in his way. Even this is the\\n\\nhighest duty, O Yudhishthira, of royal sages. They should die either in\\n\\nbattle or in the woods agreeably to the scriptures. Thy royal sire,\\n\\nPandu, O king of kings, reverenced this old king as a disciple reverences\\n\\nhis preceptor.

Her determination is as strong as a rock and she did become the reason of Bheesma\\u2019s death on the 10th day of Kurukhshetra battle. She was reborn as Shikhandi \\u2013 half woman/half man.

The king instructed the Suta Sanjaya to cast off his celestial bow Gandiva and his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value.\\n\\nThe Suta Sanjaya obeyed the king's instructions and proceeded to the woods of Khandava. As he approached the forest, the fire grew in intensity, and the king's chariot was engulfed in flames. The Suta Sanjaya then cast off Gandiva and his quivers, and the fire produced a general conflagration in the forest.\\n\\nThe immediate consequences of the burning of the Khandava Forest were:\\n\\n1.

He then bathed in the sacred\\n\\nstream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.\\n\\nThe wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to\\n\\nburn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt\\n\\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\\n\\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\\n\\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\\n\\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\\n\\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,\\n\\nexceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the\\n\\nconflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,\\n\\nthat foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,--'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a\\n\\nplace where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nuniverse. The sound of lamentations uttered by those weeping heroes,\\n\\nfilling the spacious chambers of the palace, escaped therefrom and\\n\\npenetrated the very welkin.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XXXIX\\n\\n\\\"Narada said, 'The king has not been burnt to death by an unsanctified\\n\\nfire. I have heard this there. I tell thee, O Bharata, such has not been\\n\\nthe fate of Vichitraviryya. It has been heard by us that when the old\\n\\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\\n\\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\\n\\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nbanks of Ganga. United with that (sacred) fire of his own, O chief of the\\n\\nBharatas, the king, as I have already said unto thee, met with death on\\n\\nthe banks of Ganga. O sinless one, this is what the ascetics have told\\n\\nme,--those, viz., whom I saw on the banks of the sacred Bhagirathi, O\\n\\nYudhishthira. Thus O lord of Earth, king Dhritarashtra, coming into\\n\\ncontact with his own sacred fire, departed from this world and attained\\n\\nto that high goal that has been his. Through service rendered by her to\\n\\nher seniors, thy mother, O lord of men, has attained to very great\\n\\nsuccess. There is not the slightest doubt of this. It behoveth thee, O\\n\\nking of kings, to now discharge the rites of water to their honour, with\\n\\nall thy brothers. Let, therefore, the necessary steps be taken towards\\n\\nthat end.'\\n\\npleased, at the command of Dhritarashtra. He beheld many sacrificial\\n\\naltars with sacred fires blazing on them and with many ascetics seated on\\n\\nthem, that had performed their oblations and poured libations in honour\\n\\nof the deities. Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the\\n\\nforest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled\\n\\nupwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics\\n\\npossessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many\\n\\nthat belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or\\n\\nresting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also\\n\\nwere there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole\\n\\nforest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and\\n\\nKokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with\\n\\nthe chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas. Some were adorned\\n\\nthere. Overspread with bones and hair, it was noisome with worms and insects. It was skirted all along with a blazing fire. It was infested by crows and other birds and vultures, all having beaks of iron, as also by evil spirits with long mouths pointed like needles. And it abounded with inaccessible fastnesses like the Vindhya mountains. Human corpses were scattered over it, smeared with fat and blood, with arms and thighs cut off, or with entrails torn out and legs severed.\"]}": {

Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\npersons in sacrifices and in obsequial rites, after the manner of all the\\n\\ngreat kings of antiquity. The high-minded son of Kunti is mild, and\\n\\nself-restrained, and is always disposed to spend as if he were a second\\n\\nVaisravana. He has great ministers that attend on him. He is\\n\\ncompassionate to even his foes. Indeed, that foremost one of Bharata's\\n\\nrace is of pure conduct. Endued with great intelligence, he is perfectly\\n\\nstraight-forward in his dealings and rules and protects us like a father\\n\\nprotecting his children. From association with him who is the son of\\n\\nDharma, O royal sage, Bhima and Arjuna and others will never do us the\\n\\nleast wrong. They are mild, O thou of Kuru's race, unto them that are\\n\\nmild, and fierce like snakes of virulent poison unto them that are\\n\\nfierce. Possessed of great energy, those high-souled ones are always\\n\\ndevoted to the good of the people. Neither Kunti, nor thy\\n\\n(daughter-in-law) Panchali, nor Ulupi, nor the princess of the Sattwata\\n\\nall women duly honouring the king said, with proper salutations,--Alas,\\n\\nwhen shall I see queen Pritha, if, indeed, she be yet alive. I shall\\n\\nconsider my life as not passed in vain if I succeed in beholding her once\\n\\nmore, O king. Let this sort of understanding be ever stable in thee. Let\\n\\nthy mind always take a pleasure in such righteousness as is involved, O\\n\\nking of kings, in thy desire of bestowing such a high boon on us. Know, O\\n\\nking, that all these ladies of thy house are staying with their feet\\n\\nraised for the journey, from desire of beholding Kunti, and Gandhari, and\\n\\nmy father-in-law. Thus addressed by queen Draupadi, the king, O chief of\\n\\nBharata's race, summoned all the leaders of his forces to his presence\\n\\nand told them,--'Cause my army, teeming with cars and elephants, to march\\n\\nout. I shall behold king Dhritarashtra who is now living in the woods.'\\n\\nUnto those that supervised the concerns of the ladies, the king gave the\\n\\n(King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nmighty bowman who sits besides him, of darkish complexion and youthful\\n\\nframe, who resembles the leader of an elephantine herd, whose shoulders\\n\\nare as high as those of a lion, who walks like a sporting elephant, and\\n\\nwhose eyes are as expansive as the petals of a lotus, is the hero called\\n\\nArjuna. Those two foremost of men, that are sitting besides Kunti, are\\n\\nthe twins, resembling Vishnu and Mahendra. In this whole world of men,\\n\\nthey have not their equals in beauty and strength and excellence of\\n\\nconduct. This lady, of eyes as expansive as lotus petals, who seems to\\n\\nhave touched the middle age of life, whose complexion resembles that of\\n\\nthe blue lotus, and who looks like a goddess of Heaven, is Krishna, the\\n\\nembodied form of the goddess of prosperity.[39] She who sits besides her,\\n\\npossessed of the complexion of pure gold, who looks like the embodied\\n\\nrays of the moon, in the midst of the other ladies, is, ye foremost of\\n\\n\\\"He also beheld the princess of Pancala, decked in garlands of lotuses. Having attained to Heaven, she was sitting there, endued with a form possessed of solar splendour. King Yudhishthira suddenly wished to question her. Then the illustrious Indra, the chief of the gods, spoke to him, This one is Sree herself. It was for your sake that she took birth, as the daughter of Drupada, among human beings, issuing not from any mothers womb, O Yudhishthira, endued with agreeable perfume and capable of delighting the whole world. For your pleasure, she was created by the wielder of the trident. She was born in the race of Drupada and was enjoyed by you all. These five highly blessed Gandharvas endued with the effulgence of fire, and possessed of great energy, were, O king, the sons of Draupadi and yourself.\\n\\nthem in return according to due rites, the mighty-armed hero, accompanied\\n\\nby those princes, took rest like a ship-wrecked man tossed on the waves\\n\\nresting on reaching the shore. Meanwhile king Vabhruvahan of great\\n\\nwisdom, accompanied by his mothers (Chitrangada and Ulupi), came to the\\n\\nKuru capital. The mighty-armed prince duly saluted all his seniors of\\n\\nKuru's race and the other kings present there, and was honoured by them\\n\\nall in return. He then entered the excellent abode of his grand-mother\\n\\nKunti.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION LXXXVIII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'Entering the palace of the Pandavas the mighty-armed\\n\\nprince saluted his grand-mother in soothing and sweet accents. Then queen\\n\\nChitrangada, and (Ulupi) the daughter of (the snake) Kauravya, together\\n\\napproached Partha and Krishna with humility. They then met Subhadra and\\n\\nthe other ladies of the Kuru race with due formalities. Kunti gave them\\n\\nmany gems and costly things. Draupadi and Subhadra and the other ladies\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nwere checked in battle,--heroes that were equal to Indra himself in\\n\\nmight--why would not he ascend to Heaven? O irresistible one, do thou\\n\\nkill this grief of thine. Do not suffer thyself to be swayed by wrath.\\n\\nThat conqueror of hostile cities has attained in that sanctified goal\\n\\nwhich depends upon death at the edge of weapons. After the fall of that\\n\\nhero, this my sister Subhadra stricken with grief, indulged in loud\\n\\nlamentations, when she saw Kunti, like a female ospray. When she met\\n\\nDraupadi, she asked her in grief,--O reverend lady, where are all our\\n\\nsons? I desire to behold them. Hearing her lamentations, all the Kaurava\\n\\nladies embraced her and wept sitting around her. Beholding (her\\n\\ndaughter-in-law) Uttara, she said,--'O blessed girl, where has thy\\n\\nhusband gone? When he comes back, do thou, without losing a moment,\\n\\napprise me of it. Alas, O daughter of Virata, as soon he heard my voice,\\n\\nhe used to come out of his chamber without the loss of a moment. Why does\\n\\nKarna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and she uses it to create jealously among the cousins time and again. Apart from Duryodhana, many men lusted for her. This provoked the disrobing incident to a grat extent. Inference: Do not ask for things you can\\u2019t handle, lower your standards. Also, dont be besotted by your beauty and looks, for they are likely to go against you. Beware of the company you keep \\u2013 Shakuni Young Duryodhana is not as arrogant. But he is slowly spoiled by Gandhar prince, Shakuni. Shakuni slowly fills Duryodhana\\u2019s heart with bitterness and exploits him. Duryodhana is an unmellowed clay, he is provoked to be raged against Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the\\n\\nLessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nthe other ladies of the Kuru race with due formalities. Kunti gave them\\n\\nmany gems and costly things. Draupadi and Subhadra and the other ladies\\n\\nof Kuru's race all made presents to them. The two ladies took up their\\n\\nresidence there, using costly beds and seats, treated with affection and\\n\\nrespect by Kunti herself from desire of doing what was agreeable to\\n\\nPartha. King Vabhruvahana of great energy, duly honoured (by Kunti), then\\n\\nmet Dhritarashtra according to due rites. Repairing then to king\\n\\nYudhishthira and Bhima and the other Pandavas, the mighty prince of\\n\\nManipura saluted them all with humility. They all embraced him with great\\n\\naffection and honoured him duly. And those mighty car-warriors highly\\n\\ngratified with him, made large gifts of wealth unto him. The king of\\n\\nManipura then humbly approached Krishna, that hero armed with the discus\\n\\nand the mace, like a second Pradyumna approaching his sire. Krishna gave\\n\\ncontinuous practice. They focused on their goals. It was regular practice, dedication and commitment of Arjuna which made him powerful during war and he defeated great warriors of Kauravas. After the loss of their kingdom, Pandavas tried to work on their weaknesses and learned new skills. Arjuna utilized the time during their exile to acquire new weapons. Yudhishthra acquired teachings from various Rishis and learned the game of dice. Business promoters must experience their products and plans in order to survive in long run. They need to concentrate on continuous improvement for the success of business. 3.15 Women empowerment Women empowerment means participation of women in decision making. Participation of women in decision making helps to view the situation in holistic way. Harmonious, feminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"In the Mahabharata, the concept of Time (Kala) is portrayed as both a destroyer and a preserver, reflecting the complex and multifaceted nature of time. Here's an analysis of how Time is portrayed in different parvas:\\n\\n**Destroyer of the Vrishnis (Parva 1-2)**\\n\\nIn the first two parvas, Time is depicted as a destructive force that ravages the Vrishni heroes. The iron bolts generated by the curse of Brahmanas destroy the Vrishnis, leaving them in a state of chaos and destruction. This portrayal of Time as a destroyer is evident in the words of Yudhishthira, \\\"Winds, dry and strong, and showering gravels, blew from every side. Birds began to wheel, making circles from right to left. The great rivers ran in opposite directions.\\\" (Parva 1, verse 1)\\n\\n**Preserver of the Vrishnis (Parva 3-4)**\\n\\nHowever, in the third and fourth parvas, Time is portrayed as a preserver, protecting the Vrishnis from destruction. The slayer of Keshi, Janardana, understands the omens that Time shows and knows that the thirty-sixth year has come, which will lead to the destruction of the Vrishnis. This is evident in the words of Vasudeva, \\\"The present is exactly similar to that time when Yudhishthira noted at such awful omens when the two armies had been arrayed in order of battle.\\\" (Parva 3, verse 1)\\n\\n**Destroyer of the Vrishnis (Parva 5-6)**\\n\\nIn the fifth and sixth parvas, Time is again depicted as a destroyer, but this time it is the Kaurava general Drona who is responsible for the destruction of the Vrishnis. Drona's actions are portrayed as a result of his pride and arrogance, which ultimately lead to the destruction of the Vrishnis. This is evident in the words of Vasudeva, \\\"The blessed hero armed with the plough will enter the ocean, casting off his body, while a hunter of the name of Jara will pierce the high-souled Krishna while lying on the ground.\\\" (Parva 5, verse 1)\\n\\n**Preserver of the Vrishnis (Parva 7-8)**\\n\\nIn the seventh and eighth parvas, Time is portrayed as a preserver, protecting the Vrishnis from destruction. The slayer of Madhu, informed of the impending destruction, summons all the Vrishnis and tells them of the impending doom. This is evident in the words of Vasudeva, \\\"Hrishikesa having said so, entered his mansion. The Lord of the universe did not wish to ordain otherwise.\\\" (Parva 7, verse 1)\\n\\n**Destroyer of the Vrishnis (Parva 9-10)**\\n\\nIn the ninth and tenth parvas, Time is again depicted as a destroyer, but this time it is the Kukura and the Andhaka who are responsible for the destruction of the Vrishnis. The Kukuras and the Andhakas are portrayed as being consumed by their own pride and arrogance, which ultimately lead to their destruction. This is evident in the words of Vasudeva, \\\"As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them thought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had come, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything.\\\" (Parva 9, verse 1)\\n\\n**Preserver of the Vrishnis (Parva 11-12)**\\n\\nIn the eleventh and twelfth parvas, Time is portrayed as a preserver, protecting the Vrishnis from destruction. The Kaurava general Bhima is portrayed as being consumed by his own pride and arrogance, which ultimately lead to his destruction. This is evident in the words of Vasudeva, \\\"The destruction of this our race has at last come. Vibhatsu will come to this city, Dwaravati. Tell him what has occurred, this great carnage of the Vrishnis.\\\" (Parva 11, verse 1)\\n\\n**Destroyer of the Vrishnis (Parva 13-14)**\\n\\nIn the thirteenth and fourteenth parvas, Time is again depicted as a destroyer, but this time it is the Kukura and the Andhaka who are responsible for the destruction of the Vrishnis. The Kukuras and the Andhakas are portrayed as being consumed by their own pride and arrogance, which ultimately lead to their destruction. This is evident in the words of Vasudeva, \\\"The destruction of this our race has at last come. Vibhatsu will come to this city, Dwaravati. Tell him what has occurred, this great carnage of the Vrishnis.\\\" (Parva 13, verse 1)\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of Time in the Mahabharata is portrayed as both a destroyer and a preserver, reflecting the complex and multifaceted nature of time. The destruction of the Vrishnis is depicted as a result of their pride and arrogance, while the preservation of the Vrishnis is depicted as a result of their humility and devotion to the gods.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Analyze how the concept of Time (Kala) is portrayed as both a destroyer and preserver throughout the epic, using specific examples from different parvas?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"1\\n\\nOm!

Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\\n\\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\\n\\nseen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse\\n\\nkinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\n\\\"Upon the conclusion of all the Parvas, the house-holder of wisdom should give unto the reciter a copy of the Mahabharata with a piece of gold. When the Harivansa Parva is being recited, Brahmanas should be fed with frumenty at each successive Parana, O king. Having finished all the Parvas, one versed in the scriptures, robing himself in white, wearing garlands, decked with ornaments, and properly purified, should place a copy of the Mahabharata on an auspicious spot and cover it with a piece of silken cloth and worship it, according to due rites, with scents and garlands, offering each at a time. Indeed, O king, the several volumes of this treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated mind. Offerings should be made unto them of diverse kinds of food and garlands and drinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold and other precious metals should be given as Dakshina. The names should then be taken of all the deities as also of Nara and Narayana. Then,\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened).

At Prabhasa, through iron\\n\\nbolts generated by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has\\n\\ntaken place of the Vrishni heroes. Awful hath that carnage been, and not\\n\\neven a single hero has escaped. The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and\\n\\nthe Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all endued with high souls, great\\n\\nmight, and leonine pride, have slaughtered one another in battle.\\n\\nPossessed of arms that looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing\\n\\nthe strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with\\n\\nblades of Eraka grass. Behold the perverse course of Time. 500,000\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\none should manufacture wines and intoxicating spirits of any kind, and\\n\\nthat whoever would secretly manufacture wines and spirits should be\\n\\nimpaled alive with all his kinsmen. Through fear of the king, and knowing\\n\\nthat it was the command of Rama also of unimpeachable deeds, all the\\n\\ncitizens bound themselves by a rule and abstained from manufacturing\\n\\nwines and spirits.\\\"\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n2\\n\\nVaishampayana said: \\\"While the Vrishnis and the Andhakas were thus\\n\\nendeavouring (to avoid the impending calamity), the embodied form of Time\\n\\n(death) every day wandered about their houses. He looked like a man of\\n\\nterrible and fierce aspect. Of bald head, he was black and of tawny\\n\\ncomplexion. Sometimes he was seen by the Vrishnis as he peered into their\\n\\nhouses. The mighty bowmen among the Vrishnis shot hundreds and thousands\\n\\nof shafts at him, but none of these succeeded in piercing him, for he was\\n\\nnone else than the Destroyer of all creatures.

The horizon on every side seemed to be\\n\\nalways covered with fog. Meteors, showering (blazing) coals, fell on the\\n\\nEarth from the sky. The Suns disc, O king, seemed to be always covered\\n\\nwith dust. At its rise, the great luminary of day was shorn of splendour\\n\\nand seemed to be crossed by headless trunks (of human beings).

The blessed hero armed with the plough will enter the ocean,\\n\\ncasting off his body, while a hunter of the name of Jara will pierce the\\n\\nhigh-souled Krishna while lying on the ground.\\n\\n\\\"Endeavoured to be deceived by those wicked ones, those ascetics, with\\n\\neyes red in wrath, looked at each other and uttered those words. Having\\n\\nsaid so they then proceeded to see Keshava. The slayer of Madhu, informed\\n\\nof what had taken place, summoned all the Vrishnis and told them of it.\\n\\nPossessed of great intelligence and fully acquainted with what the end of\\n\\nhis race would be, he simply said that that which was destined would\\n\\nsurely happen. Hrishikesa having said so, entered his mansion. The Lord\\n\\nof the universe did not wish to ordain otherwise. When the next day came,\\n\\nSamva actually brought forth an iron bolt through which all the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nmade the fifteenth by Rahu once more. Such a day had happened at the time\\n\\nof the great battle of the Bharatas. It has once more appeared, it seems,\\n\\nfor our destruction. \\\"The slayer of Keshi, Janardana, thinking upon the\\n\\nomens that Time showed, understood that the thirty-sixth year had come,\\n\\nand that what Gandhari, burning with grief on account of the death of her\\n\\nsons, and deprived of all her kinsmen, had said was about to transpire.\\n\\nThe present is exactly similar to that time when Yudhishthira noted at\\n\\nsuch awful omens when the two armies had been arrayed in order of battle.\\n\\nVasudeva, having said so, endeavoured to bring about those occurrences\\n\\nwhich would make Gandharis words true. That chastiser of foes commanded\\n\\nthe Vrishnis to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water. The messengers\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\nanother in that fearful melee. Indeed, O king, whoever amongst them took\\n\\nup in wrath a few blades of the Eraka grass, these, in his hands, became\\n\\nsoon converted into a thunderbolt, O puissant one. Every blade of grass\\n\\nthere was seen to be converted into a terrible iron bolt. All this, know,\\n\\nO king, was due to the curse denounced by Brahmanas. He who hurled a\\n\\nblade of grass saw that it pierced through even such things as were\\n\\nutterly impenetrable. In fact, every blade was seen to become a terrible\\n\\nbolt having the force of thunder. Son killed sire, and sire killed son, O\\n\\nBharata. Inebriated with wine, they rushed and fell upon one another. The\\n\\nKukuras and the Andhakas met with destruction like insects rushing at a\\n\\nblazing fire. As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them\\n\\nthought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had\\n\\ncome, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything. Indeed,\\n\\nrace, \\\"The destruction of this our race has at last come. Vibhatsu will\\n\\ncome to this city, Dwaravati. Tell him what has occurred, this great\\n\\ncarnage of the Vrishnis. I have no doubt that as soon as he will hear of\\n\\nthe destruction of the Yadus, that hero of mighty energy will come here\\n\\nwithout any loss of time. Know, O father, that I am Arjuna and Arjuna is\\n\\nmyself. That should be done by thee which he would say. The son of Pandu\\n\\nwill do what is best for the women and the children.

As regards myself, retiring to some sacred place, I shall bide my\\n\\nhour, with the intelligent Rama in my company, observing strict vows all\\n\\nthe while.\\\" Having said these words unto me, Hrishikesa of inconceivable\\n\\nprowess, leaving me with the children, has gone away to some spot which I\"]}": {

Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nthy brother.

In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes.

The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nassisted by the twins.

He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons.

For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nforemost of men, viz., king Yudhishthira, said unto the chief of the\\n\\nVrishnis that it was even so. The princess Draupadi, however, looked\\n\\nangrily and askance at Krishna, (for she could not bear the ascription of\\n\\nany fault to Arjuna). The slayer of Kesi, viz., Hrishikesa, approved of\\n\\nthat indication of love (for his friend) which the princess of Panchala,\\n\\nwho also was his friend, displayed.[204] Bhimasena and the other Kurus,\\n\\nincluding the sacrificial priests, who heard of the agreeable triumphs of\\n\\nArjuna in course of his following the horse, became highly gratified.\\n\\nWhile they were still engaged in discoursing on Arjuna, an envoy came\\n\\nfrom that high-souled hero bearing a message from him. Repairing to the\\n\\npresence of the Kuru king, the intelligent envoy bowed his head in\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\nintelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded\\n\\nArjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the\\n\\nTrigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in\\n\\nscorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the\\n\\nclatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then\\n\\nSuryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya\\n\\nwith hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who\\n\\nfollowed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction\\n\\nof Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\nking's eyes. Large gifts were made to the messenger for the very\\n\\nagreeable tidings he had brought. On the second day from that date, a\\n\\nloud din was heard when that foremost of men, that chief of the Kurus,\\n\\ncame. The dust raised by the hoofs of that horse as it walked in close\\n\\nadjacence to Arjuna, looked as beautiful as that raised by the celestial\\n\\nsteed Uchchaisravas. And as Arjuna advanced he heard many gladdening\\n\\nwords uttered by the citizens. 'By good luck, O Partha, thou art out of\\n\\ndanger. Praise to you and king Yudhishthira! Who else than Arjuna could\\n\\ncome back after having caused the horse to wander over the whole Earth\\n\\nand after having vanquished all the kings in battle? We have not heard of\\n\\nsuch a feat having been achieved by even Sagara and other high-souled\\n\\nequipped agreeably to the ordinances of the treatises (on war-elephants).\\n\\nIrresistible in battle, it had become so infuriate as to be beyond\\n\\ncontrol. Urged on by the prince with the iron-hook, that mighty elephant\\n\\nthen seemed (as it advanced) as if it would cut through the welkin (like\\n\\na flying hill). Beholding it advance towards him, O king, Dhananjaya,\\n\\nfilled with rage and standing on the earth, O Bharata, encountered the\\n\\nprince on its back. Filled with wrath, Vajradatta quickly sped at Arjuna\\n\\na number of broad-headed shafts endued with the energy of fire and\\n\\nresembling (as they coursed through the air) a cloud of speedily-moving\\n\\nlocusts. Arjuna, however, with shafts sped from Gandiva, cut off those\\n\\narrows, some into two and some into three pieces. He cut them off in the\\n\\nwelkin itself with those shafts of his coursing through the welkin. The\\n\\nson of Bhagadatta, beholding his broad-headed shafts thus cut off,\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\\n\\nKetuvarman, the younger brother of Suryavarman, and possessed of youthful\\n\\nvigour, fought, for the sake of his brother, against Pandu's son\\n\\npossessed of great fame. Beholding Ketuvarman approaching towards him for\\n\\nbattle, Vibhatsu, that slayer of hostile heroes, slew him with many\\n\\nsharp-pointed arrows. Upon Ketuvarman's fall, the mighty car-warrior\\n\\nDhritavarman, rushing on his car towards Arjuna, showered a perfect\\n\\ndownpour of arrows on him. Beholding that lightness of hand displayed by\\n\\nthe youth Dhritavarman, Gudakesa of mighty energy and great prowess\\n\\nbecame highly gratified with him. The son of Indra could not see when the\\n\\nyoung warrior took out his arrows and when he placed them on his\\n\\nbow-string aiming at him. He only saw showers of arrows in the air. For a\\n\\nbrief space of time, Arjuna gladdened his enemy and mentally admired his\\n\\nthem repeatedly to desist, but they did not listen to him. Rukmini, the\\n\\nprincess of Gandhara, Saivya, Haimavati, and queen Jamvabati ascended the\\n\\nfuneral pyre. Satyabhama and other dear wives of Krishna entered the\\n\\nwoods, O king, resolved to set themselves to the practice of penances.\\n\\nThey began to live on fruits and roots and pass their time in the\\n\\ncontemplation of Hari. Going beyond the Himavat, they took up their abode\\n\\nin a place called Kalpa. Those men who had followed Arjuna from\\n\\nDwaravati, were distributed into groups, and bestowed upon Vajra. Having\\n\\ndone all these acts suited to the occasion, Arjuna, with eyes bathed in\\n\\ntears, then entered the retreat of Vyasa. There he beheld the Island-born\\n\\nRishi seated at his ease.\\\"\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n8\\n\\nVaishampayana said: \\\"As Arjuna entered the asylum of the truthful Rishi,\\n\\nhe beheld the son of Satyavati seated in a secluded spot.\\n\\n\\\"Approaching that Rishi of high vows and endued with a knowledge of all\"]}": {

For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nthe celestials in the midst of the denizens of Heaven. The sons of Pandu,\\n\\nsurrounded by the assembled kings, looked as beautiful, O king, as the\\n\\nplanets in the midst of the stars. Unto those kings they made presents of\\n\\nvarious jewels and gems, and elephants and horses and ornaments of gold,\\n\\nand female slaves and cloths and large measures of gold. Indeed, Pritha's\\n\\nson by distributing that untold wealth among the invited monarchs, shone,\\n\\nO king, like Vaisravana, the lord of treasures. Summoning next the heroic\\n\\nking Vabhruvahana, Yudhishthira gave unto him diverse kinds of wealth in\\n\\nprofusion and gave him permission to return home. The son of Pandu, for\\n\\ngratifying his sister Dussala, established her infant grandson in his\\n\\npaternal kingdom. The Kuru king Yudhishthira, having a full control over\\n\\nhis senses, then dismissed the assembled kings all of whom had been\\n\\nproperly classed and honoured by him.[212] The illustrious son of Pandu,\\n\\n\\\"Though thus addressed by Narada, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, endued with great intelligence, enquired about his brothers and said, If these eternal regions reserved for heroes be Duryodhanas, that unrighteous and sinful wight, that man who was the destroyer of friends and of the whole world, that man for whose sake the entire Earth was devastated with all her horses and elephants and human beings, that wight for whose sake we were burnt with wrath in thinking of how best we might remedy our wrongs, I desire to see what regions have been attained by those high-souled heroes, my brothers of high vows, steady achievers of promises, truthful in speech, and distinguished for courage. The high-souled Karna, the son of Kunti, incapable of being baffled in battle, Dhrishtadyumna, Satyaki, the sons of Dhrishtadyumna and those other Kshatriyas who met with death in the observance of Kshatriya practices, where are those lords of Earth, O Brahmana? I do not see them here, O Narada. I desire to\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nrace, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion of Renunciation, traversed through various countries and reached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind him was Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order of their birth; behind them all, O foremost one of Bharatas race, proceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of dark complexion, and endued with eyes resembling lotus petals. While the Pandavas set out for the forest, a dog followed them.\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\\n\\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\"]}": {

Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nseen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse\\n\\nkinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nof Krishna, given by Agni, made of iron and having its nave composed of\\n\\nhardest adamant, ascended into the firmament. In the very sight of\\n\\nDaruka, the excellent car of Vasudeva, of solar effulgence, and properly\\n\\nequipped, was taken away by the horses yoked unto it. Those foremost of\\n\\nsteeds, numbering four, (Saivya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Valahaka), and\\n\\nendued with the speed of thought, fled away, dragging the car after them\\n\\nalong the surface of the ocean. The two great standards of Krishnas car\\n\\nand Valadevas car, that with the device of Garuda and that bearing the\\n\\ndevice of the palmyra, which were reverently worshipped by those two\\n\\nheroes, were taken away by Apsaras who, day and night, called upon the\\n\\nVrishnis and the Andhakas to set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred\\n\\nwater. When these omens were seen and heard, those foremost of men, the\\n\\nmighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, became desirous of\\n\\nthat region, sacred to the deity of deities, O king, became exceedingly\\n\\ndelightful. Having performed the worship of Rudra and of all the Ganas,\\n\\nthe king, placing Vyasa ahead, proceeded towards the place where the\\n\\ntreasure was buried. Once more worshipping the Lord of treasures, and\\n\\nbowing unto him with reverence and saluting him properly, with diverse\\n\\nkinds of flowers and cakes and Krisara, having worshipped those foremost\\n\\nof gems, viz., Sankha and Nidhi, and those Yakshas who are the lords of\\n\\ngems, and having worshipped many foremost of Brahmanas and caused them to\\n\\nutter blessings, the king endued with great puissance, strengthened by\\n\\nthe energy and the auspicious benedictions of those Brahmanas, caused\\n\\nthat spot to be excavated. Then numerous vessels of diverse and\\n\\ndelightful forms, and Bhringaras and Katahas and Kalasas and\\n\\nBardhamanakas, and innumerable Bhajanas of beautiful forms, were dug out\\n\\nby king Yudhishthira the just. The wealth thus dug out was placed in\\n\\nforemost of men, viz., king Yudhishthira, said unto the chief of the\\n\\nVrishnis that it was even so. The princess Draupadi, however, looked\\n\\nangrily and askance at Krishna, (for she could not bear the ascription of\\n\\nany fault to Arjuna). The slayer of Kesi, viz., Hrishikesa, approved of\\n\\nthat indication of love (for his friend) which the princess of Panchala,\\n\\nwho also was his friend, displayed.[204] Bhimasena and the other Kurus,\\n\\nincluding the sacrificial priests, who heard of the agreeable triumphs of\\n\\nArjuna in course of his following the horse, became highly gratified.\\n\\nWhile they were still engaged in discoursing on Arjuna, an envoy came\\n\\nfrom that high-souled hero bearing a message from him. Repairing to the\\n\\npresence of the Kuru king, the intelligent envoy bowed his head in\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\nover the Earth.'\\n\\n\\\"Yudhishthira said, 'Let arrangements be made by thee, O regenerate one,\\n\\nabout loosening this horse for enabling it to wander over the Earth at\\n\\nits will. It behoveth thee, O ascetic, to say who will protect this steed\\n\\nwhile roaming over the Earth freely according to its will.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed (by king Yudhishthira), O\\n\\nmonarch, the Island-born Krishna said,--'He who is born after Bhimasena,\\n\\nwho is the foremost of all bowmen, who is called Jishnu, who is endued\\n\\nwith great patience and capable of overcoming all resistance,--he will\\n\\nprotect the horse. That destroyer of the Nivatakavachas is competent to\\n\\nconquer the whole Earth. In him are all celestial weapons. His body is\\n\\nlike that of a celestial in its powers of endurance. His bow and quivers\\n\\nare celestial. Even he will follow this horse.--He is well versed in both\\n\\nReligion and wealth. He is a master of all the sciences. O foremost of\\n\\nfor the purpose of the safety of their palace. The weapons used in the war were very scientific. The modern technology used by the big business houses is based on these ancient scientific skills and knowledge. Moreover, corporate houses are able to use good infrastructure by conceiving the ideas from the history. Technology learnt today will certainly provide fruitful results. Thus, organizations must constantly improve their technology especially during the phase of growth. 3.2 Leadership Skills Centralized leadership may not give good and effective results. Corporate should concentrate on expanded management and decentralized leadership. They should restructure their teams to share management responsibilities. The sharing of responsibilities through decentralization will generate new ideas, innovative practices. This will help the team members to take responsibilities and grow higher. In addition organizations will earn more profits and achieve their goals in lesser time. In\\n\\na wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw away the head unknowingly and head broke into pieces. In this way strategic management by Krishna saved Arjuna 3.10 Situational Management Mahabharata also teaches us situational management. Krishna a well renowned crisis manager tried to administer the situation many times in Mahabharata. One of the incident is illustrated here. Arjuna was saved from serpant weapon used by Karna to kill him through situational management technique opted by Krishna. Krishna pushed the chariot down in to the earth by one foot at the last moment. Due to pushing down of chariot, the serpant arrow hit the crown of Arjuna and fell on the earth without causing any harm to Arjuna. In this way situational management by Krishna saved Arjuna\\u2019s life. 3.11 Importance of Quality over Quantity Effective Management requires\\n\\nseat with all the Vrishnis sitting around him. Having washed his feet and\\n\\ndispelled his fatigue, Krishna of mighty energy, as he sat there, then\\n\\nrecounted the chief incidents of the great battle in answer to the\\n\\nquestions put to him by his sire.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LX\\n\\n\\\"Vasudeva said, 'O thou of Vrishni's race, I have repeatedly heard men\\n\\nspeaking of the wonderful battle (between the Kurus and the Pandavas).\\n\\nThou, however, O mighty-armed one, hast witnessed it with thy own eyes.\\n\\nDo thou, therefore, O sinless one, describe the battle in detail. Indeed,\\n\\ntell me how that battle took place between the high-souled Pandavas (on\\n\\nthe one side) and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa and Drona and Salya and\\n\\nothers (on the other side), between, in fact, numerous other Kshatriyas\\n\\nwell-skilled in aims, differing from one another in mien and attire, and\\n\\nhailing from diverse realms.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by his sire, he of eyes like\\n\\nAndhakas, as also of the previous slaughter of the Kurus, concluded that\\n\\nthe hour (for his own departure from the world) had come. He then\\n\\nrestrained his senses (in Yoga). Conversant with the truth of every\\n\\ntopic, Vasudeva, though he was the Supreme Deity, wished to die, for\\n\\ndispelling all doubts and establishing a certainty of results (in the\\n\\nmatter of human existence), simply for upholding the three worlds and for\\n\\nmaking the words of Atris son true. Having restrained all his senses,\\n\\nspeech, and mind, Krishna laid himself down in high Yoga.\\n\\n\\\"A fierce hunter of the name of Jara then came there, desirous of deer.\\n\\nThe hunter, mistaking Keshava, who was stretched on the earth in high\\n\\nYoga, for a deer, pierced him at the heel with a shaft and quickly came\\n\\nto that spot for capturing his prey.

Tell me all this!\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most.

Having subjugated\\n\\nthe son of Ekalavya, O king, the son of Indra, duly worshipped by the\\n\\nNishadas, then proceeded towards the southern ocean. In those regions\\n\\nbattle took place between the diadem-decked hero and the Dravidas and\\n\\nAndhras and the fierce Mahishakas and the hillmen of Kolwa.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Duty over personal desire**: Bhishma's vow of celibacy is a selfless act that prioritizes his duty to his father, King Shantanu, over his own personal desires. He renounces sex to ensure his father's happiness, demonstrating the importance of putting duty above personal desires.\\n2. **Sacrifice for the greater good**: By renouncing sex, Bhishma is willing to sacrifice his own desires and well-being for the greater good of his family and kingdom. This selfless act highlights the theme of duty versus personal desire, where the greater good takes precedence over individual desires.\\n3. **Consequences of shortsightedness**: However, Bhishma's decision ultimately leads to negative consequences, as his father's wife, Satyavati, gives birth to two children who die without a father, and the kingdom is left without a king and queen. This serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of considering the long-term consequences of one's actions and the potential risks of prioritizing duty over personal desires.\\n4. **Integrity and commitment**: Bhishma's decision also highlights the importance of integrity and commitment. Despite the challenges and difficulties that arise from his vow, Bhishma remains committed to his decision, demonstrating the value of standing by one's principles and values.\\n5. **Context-dependent decision-making**: The story also emphasizes the importance of context-dependent decision-making. Bhishma's decision is made in the context of his father's happiness, but the consequences of that decision are far-reaching and affect the entire kingdom. This serves as a reminder that decisions must be made with consideration of the broader context and potential consequences.\\n\\nOverall, Bhishma's vow of celibacy and devotion to his father's happiness reflect the complex theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata, highlighting the importance of selflessness, sacrifice, and context-dependent decision-making.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"Lessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\ncomes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context. If you do not change your decision making instinct with the context, prepare for a storm, prepare for the \\u201cMahabharata\\u201d.\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nmy behest, O son, for thou wouldst then attain to great merit. Fight thy\\n\\nfather, this foremost one of Kuru's race, this hero that is irresistible\\n\\nin battle. Without doubt, he will then be gratified with thee.' In this\\n\\nway was king Vabhruvahana incited against his sire by his (step) mother.\\n\\nAt last, endued as he was with great energy, he made up his mind, O chief\\n\\nof the Bharata's, to fight Dhananjaya. Putting on his armour of bright\\n\\ngold and his effulgent head-gear, he ascended an excellent car which had\\n\\nhundreds of quivers ready on it. That car was equipt with necessaries for\\n\\nbattle and had steeds yoked to it that were endued with the speed of the\\n\\nmind. It had excellent wheels and a strong Upashkara, and was adorned\\n\\nwith golden ornaments of every kind. Raising his standard which was\\n\\ndecorated most beautifully and which bore the device of a lion in gold,\\n\\nthe handsome prince Vabhruvahana proceeded against his sire for battle.\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee.

Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nSudras of his realm. Whatever wrongs were done to him by the sons of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, king Yudhishthira, forgot them all, and reverenced his\\n\\nuncle. If any man did anything that was not agreeable to the son of\\n\\nAmvika, he became thereby an object of hatred to the intelligent son of\\n\\nKunti.

O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire.

The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna, reflecting on that endeavour of theirs, forbade\\n\\nthose heroes, with conciliatory speeches, O chastiser of foes.\\n\\nDisregarding Arjuna's message, they assailed him with their shafts. The\\n\\ndiadem-decked Arjuna resisted those warriors who were under the sway of\\n\\ndarkness and passion. Jishnu, addressed them smilingly and said, 'Desist,\\n\\nye unrighteous ones. Life is a benefit (that should not be thrown away).'\\n\\nAt the time of his setting out, he had been earnestly ordered by king\\n\\nYudhishthira the just, not to slay those Kshatriyas whose kinsmen had\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra.

He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles.

Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\\n\\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\\n\\ncame to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those\\n\\nbattles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal\\n\\nones among all he fought.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\\n\\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\\n\\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\\n\\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\nintelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded\\n\\nArjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the\\n\\nTrigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in\\n\\nscorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the\\n\\nclatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then\\n\\nSuryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya\\n\\nwith hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who\\n\\nfollowed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction\\n\\nof Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\\n\\nas before. I can even repeatedly create a different order of things. Let\\n\\ngold and whatever else of wealth there is, come to this place today. Let\\n\\nall the wealth that occurs in the three worlds come here today of its own\\n\\naccord. Let all the tribes of celestial Apsaras, all the Gandharvas along\\n\\nwith the Kinnaras, and Viswavasu, and others there are (of that order),\\n\\napproach this sacrifice of mine. Let all the wealth that exists among the\\n\\nNorthern Kurus, come of their own accord to these sacrifices. Let Heaven,\\n\\nand all those who have Heaven for their home, and Dharma himself, come\\n\\nhither.'--After the ascetic had uttered these words, everything happened\\n\\nas he wished, in consequence of his penances, for Agastya was endued with\\n\\na mind that resembled a blazing fire and was possessed of extraordinary\\n\\nenergy. The Rishis who were there beheld the power of penances with\\n\\nrejoicing hearts. Filled with wonder they then said these words of grave\\n\\nimport.'\\n\\na wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw away the head unknowingly and head broke into pieces. In this way strategic management by Krishna saved Arjuna 3.10 Situational Management Mahabharata also teaches us situational management. Krishna a well renowned crisis manager tried to administer the situation many times in Mahabharata. One of the incident is illustrated here. Arjuna was saved from serpant weapon used by Karna to kill him through situational management technique opted by Krishna. Krishna pushed the chariot down in to the earth by one foot at the last moment. Due to pushing down of chariot, the serpant arrow hit the crown of Arjuna and fell on the earth without causing any harm to Arjuna. In this way situational management by Krishna saved Arjuna\\u2019s life. 3.11 Importance of Quality over Quantity Effective Management requires\"]}": {

Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted.

That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nof religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost of men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding the princes in that guise, wept aloud. They seemed to look as they had looked in days before, when with Draupadi forming the sixth in number they set out from the capital after their defeat at dice. The brothers, however, were all very cheerful at the prospect of retirement. Ascertaining the intentions of Yudhishthira and seeing the destruction of the Vrishnis, no other course of action could please them then.\\n\\n\\\"Upon the conclusion of all the Parvas, the house-holder of wisdom should give unto the reciter a copy of the Mahabharata with a piece of gold. When the Harivansa Parva is being recited, Brahmanas should be fed with frumenty at each successive Parana, O king. Having finished all the Parvas, one versed in the scriptures, robing himself in white, wearing garlands, decked with ornaments, and properly purified, should place a copy of the Mahabharata on an auspicious spot and cover it with a piece of silken cloth and worship it, according to due rites, with scents and garlands, offering each at a time. Indeed, O king, the several volumes of this treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated mind. Offerings should be made unto them of diverse kinds of food and garlands and drinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold and other precious metals should be given as Dakshina. The names should then be taken of all the deities as also of Nara and Narayana. Then,\\n\\nseventy (already enumerated), should also be carefully understood. When\\n\\none's own side has become strong and the side of the foe his become weak,\\n\\nit is then, O son of Kunti, that the king should war against the foe and\\n\\nstrive to will victory. When the enemy is strong and one's own side is\\n\\nweak, then the weak king, if possessed of intelligence, should seek to\\n\\nmake peace with the enemy. The king should collect a large store of\\n\\narticles (for his commissariat). When able to march out, he should on no\\n\\naccount make a delay, O Bharata. Besides, he should on that occasion set\\n\\nhis men to offices for which they are fit, without being moved by any\\n\\nother consideration. (When obliged to yield a portion of his territories)\\n\\nhe should give his foe only such land as does not produce crops in\\n\\nabundance. (When obliged to give wealth), he should give gold containing\\n\\nmuch base metal. (When obliged to give a portion of his forces), he\\n\\n\\\"The five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth, and a dog forming the seventh, set out on their journey. Indeed, even thus did king Yudhishthira depart, himself the head of a party of seven, from the city named after the elephant. The citizen and the ladies of the royal household followed them for some distance. None of them, however, could venture to address the king for persuading him to give up his intention. The denizens of the city then returned; Kripa and others stood around Yuyutsu as their centre. Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga chief, O thou of Kuntis race, entered the waters of Ganga. The princess Chitrangada set out for the capital of Manipura. The other ladies who were the grandmothers of Parikshit centered around him. Meanwhile the high-souled Pandavas, O thou of Kurus race, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion\\n\\nfor the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nsons of mine who were addicted to calamitous dice. Verily, I desire to\\n\\nmake those gifts, inviting all the people to my mansion.'[26]\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Having said so (to Gandhari), Dhritarashtra\\n\\nsent for Yudhishthira. The latter, at his uncle's command, brought all\\n\\nthe articles necessary. Many Brahmanas residing in Kuru-jangala, and many\\n\\nKshatriyas, many Vaisyas, and many Sudras also, came to Dhritarashtra's\\n\\nmansion, with gratified hearts. The old king, coming out of the inner\\n\\napartments, beheld them all, as also his subjects assembled together.\\n\\nBeholding all those assembled citizens and inhabitants of the provinces,\\n\\nand his well-wishers also thus gathered together, and the large number of\\n\\nBrahmanas arrived from diverge realms, king Dhritarashtra of great\\n\\nintelligence, O monarch, said these words,--'Ye all and the Kurus have\\n\\nlived together for many long years, well-wishers of each other, and each\\n\\nthen, and where was Somadatta? Thou hadst to live for thirteen years in\\n\\nthe woods, supporting thyself on the products of the wilderness. Thy\\n\\neldest father did not then look at thee with eyes of parental affection.\\n\\nHast thou forgotten, O Partha, that it was this wretch of our race, of\\n\\nwicked understanding, that enquired of Vidura, when the match at dice was\\n\\ngoing on,--'What has been won?' Hearing thus far, king Yudhishthira, the\\n\\nson of Kunti, endued with great intelligence, rebuked him and told him to\\n\\nbe silent.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XII\\n\\n\\\"Arjuna said, 'O Bhima, thou art my elder brother and, therefore, my\\n\\nsenior and preceptor.

Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"In the epic, the concept of Time (Kala) is portrayed as both a destroyer and preserver, highlighting its dual nature. Time is depicted as a force that brings about both destruction and creation, depending on the context and perspective.\\n\\nAs a destroyer, Time is shown to be responsible for the downfall of the Vrishnis and the destruction of the Yadavas. The epic states that Time (Kala) \\\"every day wandered about their houses\\\" (Section 2), symbolizing its relentless and destructive power. The Vrishnis and Andhakas attempt to avoid the impending calamity, but ultimately, Time brings about their downfall. This portrayal of Time as a destroyer is reinforced by the fact that the gods themselves are not immune to its power, as seen in the story of Rama's death.\\n\\nHowever, Time is also depicted as a preserver, as it brings about the cycle of birth, growth, and decay. The epic states that \\\"That which occurs here occurs elsewhere. That which does not occur here occurs nowhere else\\\" (Section 2), highlighting the universal and cyclical nature of Time. This perspective is reinforced by the story of the gods, who are reborn and reincarnated, illustrating the eternal and unchanging nature of Time.\\n\\nThe concept of Time is also portrayed as a force that governs the universe, with the gods and humans subject to its will. The epic states that \\\"Time is, indeed, the seed of the universe, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at its pleasure\\\" (Section 2), emphasizing its role as a governing force.\\n\\nFurthermore, the epic highlights the importance of understanding and accepting the nature of Time. The story of Rama's death serves as a reminder that Time is inevitable, and that one must learn to accept and surrender to its power. The epic states that \\\"One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes weak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that position, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others\\\" (Section 2), illustrating the transience and impermanence of all things.\\n\\nIn contrast, the epic also portrays Time as a force that can be influenced and manipulated by human actions. The story of the Yadavas' attempt to avoid the impending calamity through their actions highlights the idea that human agency can shape the course of events, albeit temporarily.

When the Harivansa Parva is being recited, Brahmanas should be fed with frumenty at each successive Parana, O king. Having finished all the Parvas, one versed in the scriptures, robing himself in white, wearing garlands, decked with ornaments, and properly purified, should place a copy of the Mahabharata on an auspicious spot and cover it with a piece of silken cloth and worship it, according to due rites, with scents and garlands, offering each at a time. Indeed, O king, the several volumes of this treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated mind. Offerings should be made unto them of diverse kinds of food and garlands and drinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold and other precious metals should be given as Dakshina.

The puissant Island-born Krishna, who will not have to come back, and who is Emancipation incarnate, made an abstract of the Bharata, moved by the desire of aiding the cause of righteousness. He made another compilation consisting of sixty lakhs of verses. Thirty lakhs of these were placed in the region of the deities. In the region of the Pitris fifteen lakhs, it should be known, are current; while in that of the Yakshas fourteen lakhs are in vogue. One lakh is current among human beings.\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee.

One should listen to the Bharata every day. One should proclaim the merits of the Bharata every day. One in whose house the Bharata occurs, has in his hands all those scriptures which are known by the name of Jaya. The Bharata is cleansing and sacred. In the Bharata are diverse topics. The Bharata is worshipped by the very gods. The Bharata is the highest goal. The Bharata, O chief of the Bharatas, is the foremost of all scriptures. One attains to Emancipation through the Bharata.

The man of learning, by reciting to others this Veda or Agama composed by (the Island-born) Krishna, earns wealth. There is no doubt in this that he who, with rapt attention, recites this history called Bharata, attains to high success. What need has that man of a sprinkling of the waters of Pushkara who attentively listens to this Bharata, while it is recited to him?

Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nmighty bowman who sits besides him, of darkish complexion and youthful\\n\\nframe, who resembles the leader of an elephantine herd, whose shoulders\\n\\nare as high as those of a lion, who walks like a sporting elephant, and\\n\\nwhose eyes are as expansive as the petals of a lotus, is the hero called\\n\\nArjuna. Those two foremost of men, that are sitting besides Kunti, are\\n\\nthe twins, resembling Vishnu and Mahendra. In this whole world of men,\\n\\nthey have not their equals in beauty and strength and excellence of\\n\\nconduct. This lady, of eyes as expansive as lotus petals, who seems to\\n\\nhave touched the middle age of life, whose complexion resembles that of\\n\\nthe blue lotus, and who looks like a goddess of Heaven, is Krishna, the\\n\\nembodied form of the goddess of prosperity.[39] She who sits besides her,\\n\\npossessed of the complexion of pure gold, who looks like the embodied\\n\\nrays of the moon, in the midst of the other ladies, is, ye foremost of\\n\\nall women duly honouring the king said, with proper salutations,--Alas,\\n\\nwhen shall I see queen Pritha, if, indeed, she be yet alive. I shall\\n\\nconsider my life as not passed in vain if I succeed in beholding her once\\n\\nmore, O king. Let this sort of understanding be ever stable in thee. Let\\n\\nthy mind always take a pleasure in such righteousness as is involved, O\\n\\nking of kings, in thy desire of bestowing such a high boon on us. Know, O\\n\\nking, that all these ladies of thy house are staying with their feet\\n\\nraised for the journey, from desire of beholding Kunti, and Gandhari, and\\n\\nmy father-in-law. Thus addressed by queen Draupadi, the king, O chief of\\n\\nBharata's race, summoned all the leaders of his forces to his presence\\n\\nand told them,--'Cause my army, teeming with cars and elephants, to march\\n\\nout. I shall behold king Dhritarashtra who is now living in the woods.'\\n\\nUnto those that supervised the concerns of the ladies, the king gave the\\n\\n(King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nrace, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion of Renunciation, traversed through various countries and reached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind him was Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order of their birth; behind them all, O foremost one of Bharatas race, proceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of dark complexion, and endued with eyes resembling lotus petals. While the Pandavas set out for the forest, a dog followed them.\\n\\nLessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nwere checked in battle,--heroes that were equal to Indra himself in\\n\\nmight--why would not he ascend to Heaven? O irresistible one, do thou\\n\\nkill this grief of thine. Do not suffer thyself to be swayed by wrath.\\n\\nThat conqueror of hostile cities has attained in that sanctified goal\\n\\nwhich depends upon death at the edge of weapons. After the fall of that\\n\\nhero, this my sister Subhadra stricken with grief, indulged in loud\\n\\nlamentations, when she saw Kunti, like a female ospray. When she met\\n\\nDraupadi, she asked her in grief,--O reverend lady, where are all our\\n\\nsons? I desire to behold them. Hearing her lamentations, all the Kaurava\\n\\nladies embraced her and wept sitting around her. Beholding (her\\n\\ndaughter-in-law) Uttara, she said,--'O blessed girl, where has thy\\n\\nhusband gone? When he comes back, do thou, without losing a moment,\\n\\napprise me of it. Alas, O daughter of Virata, as soon he heard my voice,\\n\\nhe used to come out of his chamber without the loss of a moment. Why does\\n\\nKarna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and she uses it to create jealously among the cousins time and again. Apart from Duryodhana, many men lusted for her. This provoked the disrobing incident to a grat extent. Inference: Do not ask for things you can\\u2019t handle, lower your standards. Also, dont be besotted by your beauty and looks, for they are likely to go against you. Beware of the company you keep \\u2013 Shakuni Young Duryodhana is not as arrogant. But he is slowly spoiled by Gandhar prince, Shakuni. Shakuni slowly fills Duryodhana\\u2019s heart with bitterness and exploits him. Duryodhana is an unmellowed clay, he is provoked to be raged against Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the\\n\\nthem in return according to due rites, the mighty-armed hero, accompanied\\n\\nby those princes, took rest like a ship-wrecked man tossed on the waves\\n\\nresting on reaching the shore. Meanwhile king Vabhruvahan of great\\n\\nwisdom, accompanied by his mothers (Chitrangada and Ulupi), came to the\\n\\nKuru capital. The mighty-armed prince duly saluted all his seniors of\\n\\nKuru's race and the other kings present there, and was honoured by them\\n\\nall in return. He then entered the excellent abode of his grand-mother\\n\\nKunti.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION LXXXVIII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'Entering the palace of the Pandavas the mighty-armed\\n\\nprince saluted his grand-mother in soothing and sweet accents.

Karna's illegitimate birth and lack of recognition lead to feelings of inadequacy, while Arjuna's sense of duty and loyalty lead to feelings of uncertainty and self-doubt.\\n3. **The Power of Mentorship**: Both characters benefit from the guidance of a mentor. Karna is mentored by Drona, while Arjuna is mentored by Lord Krishna.\\n\\n**Contribution to the Epic's Themes:**\\n\\n1. **The Importance of Recognition**: The parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna highlight the importance of recognition and respect in achieving one's goals and fulfilling one's potential.\\n2. **The Power of Mentorship**: The epic demonstrates the power of mentorship and guidance in helping individuals overcome their challenges and achieve their goals.\\n3. **The Complexity of Human Nature**: The characters of Karna and Arjuna illustrate the complexity of human nature, with their flaws and strengths, and the ways in which they navigate the challenges of life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the characters of Karna and Arjuna are complex and multifaceted, with both similarities and differences that contribute to the epic's themes. Their parallel journeys highlight the importance of recognition, mentorship, and the complexity of human nature, making them two of the most compelling characters in the Mahabharata.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Compare and contrast the characters of Karna and Arjuna, analyzing their similarities, differences, and how their parallel journeys contribute to the epic's themes.\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\ntoo, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of\\n\\nKurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals\\n\\nendued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the\\n\\nson of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\\n\\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\\n\\ncame to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those\\n\\nbattles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal\\n\\nones among all he fought.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\\n\\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\\n\\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\\n\\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\ncontinuous practice. They focused on their goals. It was regular practice, dedication and commitment of Arjuna which made him powerful during war and he defeated great warriors of Kauravas. After the loss of their kingdom, Pandavas tried to work on their weaknesses and learned new skills. Arjuna utilized the time during their exile to acquire new weapons. Yudhishthra acquired teachings from various Rishis and learned the game of dice. Business promoters must experience their products and plans in order to survive in long run. They need to concentrate on continuous improvement for the success of business. 3.15 Women empowerment Women empowerment means participation of women in decision making. Participation of women in decision making helps to view the situation in holistic way. Harmonious, feminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals.

I have heard this there. I tell thee, O Bharata, such has not been\\n\\nthe fate of Vichitraviryya. It has been heard by us that when the old\\n\\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\\n\\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\\n\\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nproceeded to a spot on the margin of Ganga. He then bathed in the sacred\\n\\nstream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.\\n\\nThe wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to\\n\\nburn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt\\n\\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\\n\\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\\n\\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\\n\\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\\n\\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,\\n\\nexceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the\\n\\nconflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,\\n\\nthat foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,--'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a\\n\\nplace where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure.

For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes.

Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the\\n\\nforest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled\\n\\nupwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics\\n\\npossessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many\\n\\nthat belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or\\n\\nresting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also\\n\\nwere there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole\\n\\nforest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and\\n\\nKokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with\\n\\nthe chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas.

At that time, he decided not to fight\\n\\n\\\"The five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth, and a dog forming the seventh, set out on their journey. Indeed, even thus did king Yudhishthira depart, himself the head of a party of seven, from the city named after the elephant. The citizen and the ladies of the royal household followed them for some distance. None of them, however, could venture to address the king for persuading him to give up his intention. The denizens of the city then returned; Kripa and others stood around Yuyutsu as their centre. Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga chief, O thou of Kuntis race, entered the waters of Ganga. The princess Chitrangada set out for the capital of Manipura. The other ladies who were the grandmothers of Parikshit centered around him. Meanwhile the high-souled Pandavas, O thou of Kurus race, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion\\n\\nthemselves towards him in such a way that that Kuru hero might not be\\n\\ndeprived of that happiness and all those articles of enjoyment which had\\n\\nbeen his while his sons lived. The five brothers, viz., the sons of\\n\\nPandu, behaved themselves even thus towards Dhritarashtra, living under\\n\\nhis command. Dhritarashtra also, seeing them so humble and obedient to\\n\\nhis commands and acting towards him as disciples towards preceptors,\\n\\nadopted the affectionate behaviour of a preceptor towards them in return.\\n\\nGandhari, by performing the diverse rites of the Sraddha and making gifts\\n\\nunto Brahmanas of diverse objects of enjoyment, became freed from the\\n\\ndebt she owed to her slain children. Thus did that foremost of righteous\\n\\nmen, viz., king Yudhishthira the just, possessed of great intelligence,\\n\\nalong with his brothers, worship king Dhritarashtra.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Possessed of great energy, that perpetuator of\\n\\nKuru's race, viz., the old king Dhritarashtra, could not notice any\\n\\nalong with his brothers, worship king Dhritarashtra.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Possessed of great energy, that perpetuator of\\n\\nKuru's race, viz., the old king Dhritarashtra, could not notice any\\n\\nill-will in Yudhishthira Seeing that the high-souled Pandavas were in the\\n\\nobservance of a wise and righteous conduct, king Dhritarashtra, the son\\n\\nof Amvika, became gratified with them. Suvala's daughter, Gandhari,\\n\\ncasting off all sorrow for her (slain) children, began to show great\\n\\naffection for the Pandavas as if they were her own children. Endued with\\n\\ngreat energy, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, never did anything that was\\n\\ndisagreeable to the royal son of Vichitraviryya. On the other hand, he\\n\\nalways behaved towards him in a highly agreeable way. Whatever acts,\\n\\ngrave or light, were directed by king Dhritarashtra, or the helpless\\n\\nGandhari to be done, were all accomplished with reverence, O monarch, by\\n\\nthat slayer of hostile heroes, viz., the Pandava king.

Those\\n\\nforemost ones of Bharata's race, O chief of kings, then paid their\\n\\nrespectful salutations to Gandhari, the daughter of Suvala and to Kunti,\\n\\nThey next worshipped (their uncle) Vidura and met Yuyutsu, the son of\\n\\nDhritarashtra by his Vaisya wife. Those heroes were then worshipped by\\n\\nothers and they blazed forth in beauty, O king. After this, O Bharata,\\n\\nthose heroes heard the tidings of that highly wonderful and marvellous\\n\\nand glad-some birth of thy father.

The\\n\\nwarriors who had accompanied the Pandavas, leaving the retreat, sat\\n\\nthemselves down at a little distance, alighting from their cars and the\\n\\nanimals they rode.

The destruction is described as perverse and incredible, with mighty-armed warriors being laid low and the death of Krishna being compared to the drying up of the ocean or the cooling property of fire.

Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\n\\\"I have thus, O chief of men, told everything in thy presence. He that listens with devotion to this Bharata from the beginning becomes cleansed of every sin even if he be guilty of Brahmanicide or the violation of his preceptors bed, or even if he be a drinker of alcohol or a robber of other peoples wares, or even if he be born in the Chandala order. Destroying all his sins like the maker of day destroying darkness, such a man, without doubt, sports in felicity in the region of Vishnu like Vishnu himself.\\\"\\n\\nThe End of the Svargarohanika-parva\\n\\nThe Eighteen parvas of the Mahabharata are thus complete\\n\\nthe strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with\\n\\nblades of Eraka grass.

The death of the wielder of\\n\\nSarnga is as incredible as the drying up of the ocean, the displacement\\n\\nof a mountain, the falling down of the vault of heaven, or the cooling\\n\\nproperty of fire. Deprived of the company of the Vrishni heroes, I desire\\n\\nnot to live in this world. Another incident has happened that is more\\n\\npainful than this, O thou that art possessed of wealth of penances.\\n\\nRepeatedly thinking of it, my heart is breaking. In my very sight, O\\n\\nBrahmana, thousands of Vrishni ladies were carried away by the Abhiras of\\n\\nSECTION XXIX\\n\\n(Putradarsana Parva)\\n\\n\\\"Janamejaya said, 'Tell me. O learned Brahmana, what that wonderful feat\\n\\nwas which the great Rishi Vyasa of high energy accomplished after his\\n\\npromise to the old king, made when Dhritarashtra, that lord of Earth,\\n\\nthat foremost one of Kuru's race, had taken up his abode in the forest,\\n\\nwith his wife and with his daughter-in-law Kunti; and after, indeed,\\n\\nVidura had left his own body and entered into Yudhishthira, and at the\\n\\ntime when all the sons of Pandu were staying in the ascetic retreat. For\\n\\nhow many days did the Kuru king Yudhishthira of unfading glory stay, with\\n\\nhis men, in the woods? On what food, O puissant one, did the high-souled\\n\\nPandavas support themselves, with their men, and wives, while they lived\\n\\nin the woods? O sinless one, do thou tell me this.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\nAffectionate words used with full respect can do the wonders in effective management. Mahabharata\\u2019s incident highlights the importance of effective communication. When Gandhari wished to curse Judhishthra after the war, Krishna spoke in gentle words with full respect and empathy to Gandhari and give the message to forgive Judhishthra. Gandhari understood Krishna\\u2019s message and did not curse Judhishthra. Thus, effective and empathetic communication saved Judhishthra. 3.6 Forecasting future Mahabharata also give a wonderful management message of forecasting the future and taking preventive actions accordingly. In Mahabharata, when Ashwathama planned to kill all Pandavas, Krishna forecasted the danger in the future with his sharp observation and intellectual power and took all the Pandavas to Hastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna\\n\\n\\\"Upon the conclusion of all the Parvas, the house-holder of wisdom should give unto the reciter a copy of the Mahabharata with a piece of gold. When the Harivansa Parva is being recited, Brahmanas should be fed with frumenty at each successive Parana, O king. Having finished all the Parvas, one versed in the scriptures, robing himself in white, wearing garlands, decked with ornaments, and properly purified, should place a copy of the Mahabharata on an auspicious spot and cover it with a piece of silken cloth and worship it, according to due rites, with scents and garlands, offering each at a time. Indeed, O king, the several volumes of this treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated mind. Offerings should be made unto them of diverse kinds of food and garlands and drinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold and other precious metals should be given as Dakshina. The names should then be taken of all the deities as also of Nara and Narayana. Then,\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\\n\\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. Empathy\"]}": {

Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\\n\\nregionsalas, how could he remain indifferent to such a calamity as the\\n\\ncurse denounced by the Rishis? Thyself, Narada, and the Munis, knew him\\n\\nto be the eternal and sinless Govinda, the Deity of unfading glory. Alas,\\n\\nbeing puissant Vishnu himself, he witnessed, without interfering, the\\n\\ndestruction of his kinsmen! My son must have himself allowed all this to\\n\\nhappen. He was the Lord of the universe. He did not, however, wish to\\n\\nfalsify the words of Gandhari and the Rishis, O scorcher of foes. In thy\\n\\nvery sight, O hero, thy grandson, who had been slain by Ashvatthama, was\\n\\nrevived through his energy. That friend, however, of yours did not wish\\n\\nto protect his kinsmen. Beholding his sons and grandsons and brothers and\\n\\nfriends lying dead, he said unto me these words, O chief of Bharatas\\n\\nrace, \\\"The destruction of this our race has at last come. Vibhatsu will\\n\\ncome to this city, Dwaravati. Tell him what has occurred, this great\\n\\nrace, duly and with a pure heart and body. For that reason I shall\\n\\naccomplish what is for thy good. Do my bidding without delay.' Thus\\n\\naddressed by the deity of fire, Utanka did as he was directed. The deity\\n\\nthen, gratified with him, blazed up for consuming everything. From the\\n\\npores of his body, O Bharata, in consequence of his very nature, a thick\\n\\nsmoke issued threatening terrors to the world of Nagas. With that mighty\\n\\nand wide-spreading smoke, O Bharata, everything became enveloped in\\n\\ngloom, so that nothing, O king, could any longer be seen in the world of\\n\\nthe Nagas. Cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions of the\\n\\nAiravatas, uttered by the Nagas headed by Vasuki, O Janamejaya. Enveloped\\n\\nby that smoke, the palaces could no longer be seen, O Bharata. These\\n\\nresembled woods and hill overwhelmed by a thick forest. With eyes that\\n\\nwere red in consequence of that smoke, and afflicted by the energy of the\\n\\nanother in that fearful melee. Indeed, O king, whoever amongst them took\\n\\nup in wrath a few blades of the Eraka grass, these, in his hands, became\\n\\nsoon converted into a thunderbolt, O puissant one. Every blade of grass\\n\\nthere was seen to be converted into a terrible iron bolt. All this, know,\\n\\nO king, was due to the curse denounced by Brahmanas. He who hurled a\\n\\nblade of grass saw that it pierced through even such things as were\\n\\nutterly impenetrable. In fact, every blade was seen to become a terrible\\n\\nbolt having the force of thunder. Son killed sire, and sire killed son, O\\n\\nBharata. Inebriated with wine, they rushed and fell upon one another. The\\n\\nKukuras and the Andhakas met with destruction like insects rushing at a\\n\\nblazing fire. As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them\\n\\nthought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had\\n\\ncome, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything. Indeed,\\n\\npleased, at the command of Dhritarashtra. He beheld many sacrificial\\n\\naltars with sacred fires blazing on them and with many ascetics seated on\\n\\nthem, that had performed their oblations and poured libations in honour\\n\\nof the deities. Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the\\n\\nforest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled\\n\\nupwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics\\n\\npossessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many\\n\\nthat belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or\\n\\nresting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also\\n\\nwere there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole\\n\\nforest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and\\n\\nKokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with\\n\\nthe chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas. Some were adorned\\n\\na Brahmi night.[37] When the night passed away, they all arose from their\\n\\nbeds and went through their morning acts. Pouring libations then on the\\n\\nsacred fire, they continued their journey. Their first day's experience\\n\\nof the forest proved very painful to them on account of the grieving\\n\\ninhabitants of both the city and the provinces of the Kuru kingdom.\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XIX\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'Following the advice of Vidura, the king took up his\\n\\nabode on the banks of the Bhagirathi which were sacred and deserved to be\\n\\npeopled with the righteous. There many Brahmanas who had taken up their\\n\\nabode in the woods, as also many Kshatriyas and Vaisyas and Sudras, came\\n\\nto see the old monarch. Sitting in their midst, he gladdened them all by\\n\\nhis words. Having duly worshipped the Brahmanas with their disciples, he\\n\\ndismissed them all. As evening came, the king, and Gandhari of great\\n\\nfame, both descended into the stream of the Bhagirathi and duly performed\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\"]}": {

This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished.

This allowed Krishna to use his knowledge, problem-solving skills, and strategic thinking to help the Pandavas achieve victory, rather than simply using his physical strength and fighting abilities.

He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nseat with all the Vrishnis sitting around him. Having washed his feet and\\n\\ndispelled his fatigue, Krishna of mighty energy, as he sat there, then\\n\\nrecounted the chief incidents of the great battle in answer to the\\n\\nquestions put to him by his sire.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LX\\n\\n\\\"Vasudeva said, 'O thou of Vrishni's race, I have repeatedly heard men\\n\\nspeaking of the wonderful battle (between the Kurus and the Pandavas).\\n\\nThou, however, O mighty-armed one, hast witnessed it with thy own eyes.\\n\\nDo thou, therefore, O sinless one, describe the battle in detail. Indeed,\\n\\ntell me how that battle took place between the high-souled Pandavas (on\\n\\nthe one side) and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa and Drona and Salya and\\n\\nothers (on the other side), between, in fact, numerous other Kshatriyas\\n\\nwell-skilled in aims, differing from one another in mien and attire, and\\n\\nhailing from diverse realms.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by his sire, he of eyes like\\n\\nof Krishna, given by Agni, made of iron and having its nave composed of\\n\\nhardest adamant, ascended into the firmament. In the very sight of\\n\\nDaruka, the excellent car of Vasudeva, of solar effulgence, and properly\\n\\nequipped, was taken away by the horses yoked unto it. Those foremost of\\n\\nsteeds, numbering four, (Saivya, Sugriva, Meghapushpa and Valahaka), and\\n\\nendued with the speed of thought, fled away, dragging the car after them\\n\\nalong the surface of the ocean. The two great standards of Krishnas car\\n\\nand Valadevas car, that with the device of Garuda and that bearing the\\n\\ndevice of the palmyra, which were reverently worshipped by those two\\n\\nheroes, were taken away by Apsaras who, day and night, called upon the\\n\\nVrishnis and the Andhakas to set out on a pilgrimage to some sacred\\n\\nwater. When these omens were seen and heard, those foremost of men, the\\n\\nmighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, became desirous of\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\nhave all been consumed by the Brahmanas curse. O chief of Kurus race, it\\n\\nbehoveth thee not to grieve for their destruction. That which has\\n\\nhappened had been ordained. It was the destiny of those high-souled\\n\\nwarriors. Krishna suffered it to take place although he was fully\\n\\ncompetent to baffle it. Govinda was able to alter the very course of the\\n\\nuniverse with all its mobile and immobile creatures. What need then be\\n\\nsaid of the curse of even high-souled Brahmanas? He who used to proceed\\n\\nin front of thy car, armed with discus and mace, through affection for\\n\\nthee, was the four-armed Vasudeva, that ancient rishi. That high-souled\\n\\none of expansive eyes, Krishna, having lightened the burthen of the Earth\\n\\nand cast off his (human) body, has attained to his own high seat. By thee\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\na wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw away the head unknowingly and head broke into pieces. In this way strategic management by Krishna saved Arjuna 3.10 Situational Management Mahabharata also teaches us situational management. Krishna a well renowned crisis manager tried to administer the situation many times in Mahabharata. One of the incident is illustrated here. Arjuna was saved from serpant weapon used by Karna to kill him through situational management technique opted by Krishna. Krishna pushed the chariot down in to the earth by one foot at the last moment. Due to pushing down of chariot, the serpant arrow hit the crown of Arjuna and fell on the earth without causing any harm to Arjuna. In this way situational management by Krishna saved Arjuna\\u2019s life. 3.11 Importance of Quality over Quantity Effective Management requires\\n\\nforemost of men, viz., king Yudhishthira, said unto the chief of the\\n\\nVrishnis that it was even so. The princess Draupadi, however, looked\\n\\nangrily and askance at Krishna, (for she could not bear the ascription of\\n\\nany fault to Arjuna). The slayer of Kesi, viz., Hrishikesa, approved of\\n\\nthat indication of love (for his friend) which the princess of Panchala,\\n\\nwho also was his friend, displayed.[204] Bhimasena and the other Kurus,\\n\\nincluding the sacrificial priests, who heard of the agreeable triumphs of\\n\\nArjuna in course of his following the horse, became highly gratified.\\n\\nWhile they were still engaged in discoursing on Arjuna, an envoy came\\n\\nfrom that high-souled hero bearing a message from him. Repairing to the\\n\\npresence of the Kuru king, the intelligent envoy bowed his head in\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\ndeep affliction. The servants of the Vrishnis, their horsemen, and their\\n\\ncar-warriors too, followed the procession. The citizens and the\\n\\ninhabitants of the country, at the command of Prithas son, set out at the\\n\\nsame time and proceeded, surrounding that cavalcade destitute of heroes\\n\\nand numbering only women and the aged and the children. The warriors who\\n\\nfought from the backs of elephants proceeded on elephants as huge as\\n\\nhills. The foot-soldiers also set out, together with the reserves. The\\n\\nchildren of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, all followed Arjuna. The\\n\\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out,\\n\\nkeeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudevas harem, and\\n\\nVajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna. The widows of the other\\n\\nheroes of the Bhoja, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races, lordless now,\\n\\nthat set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions.

Both are exceptional warriors, each with their own celebrated weapons - Karna with his infallible kavacha and kundala, and Arjuna with his powerful Gandiva bow. They are both deeply loyal to their friends and causes, with Karna being a loyal friend to Duryodhana and Arjuna to Krishna.\\n\\nOne of the primary similarities between Karna and Arjuna is their dedication to their chosen paths. Karna remains steadfast in his support of Duryodhana, even when it means going against his own family and moral code. Similarly, Arjuna is unwavering in his commitment to the Pandava cause, fighting valiantly in battle after battle. Both characters are also driven by a strong sense of duty and honor, which shapes their actions and decisions throughout the epic.\\n\\nHowever, there are also significant differences between the two characters. Karna is often portrayed as a tragic figure, struggling against a world that seems determined to keep him from achieving his rightful place. He is denied respect, legacy, and love, despite his many virtues and talents. Arjuna, on the other hand, is generally more fortunate in his circumstances, with the support of his brothers and Krishna.\\n\\nAnother key difference lies in their approach to conflict and violence. Karna is often depicted as a warrior who enjoys the thrill of battle, while Arjuna is more introspective and contemplative. This is perhaps most evident in the Bhagavad Gita, where Arjuna is plagued by doubts and moral qualms about the upcoming war, while Karna is eager to fight.\\n\\nThe parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna contribute to the epic's themes of duty, honor, and the human condition. Their similarities and differences serve to highlight the complexities of these themes, as well as the various ways in which they can be expressed and understood. Ultimately, both characters serve as powerful examples of the power of loyalty, dedication, and the human spirit.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Karna and Arjuna are two of the most compelling and memorable characters in the Mahabharata. While they share many similarities, their differences and parallel journeys serve to deepen the epic's themes and explore the complexities of human nature. Through their struggles and triumphs, they emerge as powerful symbols of the power of the human spirit and the enduring power of loyalty and dedication.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Compare and contrast the characters of Karna and Arjuna, analyzing their similarities, differences, and how their parallel journeys contribute to the epic's themes.\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"in the battlefield.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\ntoo, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of\\n\\nKurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals\\n\\nendued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the\\n\\nson of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\\n\\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\\n\\ncame to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those\\n\\nbattles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal\\n\\nones among all he fought.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\\n\\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\\n\\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\\n\\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No\"]}": {

The life-breath is the great\\n\\ndeity that resides in the bodies of all embodied creatures.'[217]\\n\\n\\\"The father, at this, said, 'If thou attainest to the age of even a\\n\\nthousand years, thou wilt still seem to me to be only a little child.\\n\\nHaving begotten a son, the sire achieves success through him.

Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nobservance of Kshatriya duties.' Having said these words, the old king\\n\\nthen addressed Yudhishthira in particular and said, 'Blessed be thou, O\\n\\nson of the princess of Yadu's race. Listen now to what I say. Cherished\\n\\nby thee, O son, I have lived these years very happily. I have (with thy\\n\\nhelp) made large gifts and performed Sraddhas repeatedly.[3] I have, O\\n\\nson, to the best of my power, achieved merit largely. This Gandhari,\\n\\nthough destitute of sons, has lived with great fortitude, looking all the\\n\\nwhile at me. They whom inflicted great wrongs on Draupadi and robbed thee\\n\\nof thy affluence,--those cruel wights--have all left the world, slain in\\n\\nbattle agreeably to the practice of their order.\\n\\nI have nothing to do for them, O delighter of the Kurus. Stain with their\\n\\nfaces towards battle, they have attained to those regions which are for\\n\\nwielders of weapons.[4] I should now accomplish what is beneficial and\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\\n\\nYudhishthira and the father of Duryodhana. When the Kuru king recollected\\n\\nhis wicked son, he then could not but feel unfriendly, in his heart,\\n\\ntowards Bhima. Bhimasena also, O king, impelled by a heart that seemed to\\n\\nbe wicked, was unable to put up with king Dhritarashtra. Vrikodara\\n\\nsecretly did many acts that were disagreeable to the old king. Through\\n\\ndeceitful servitors he caused the commands of his uncle to be disobeyed.\\n\\nRecollecting the evil counsels of the old king and some acts of his,\\n\\nBhima, one day, in the midst of his friends, slapped his armpits, in the\\n\\nhearing of Dhritarashtra and of Gandhari. The wrathful Vrikodara,\\n\\nrecollecting his foes Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana, gave way to a\\n\\ntransport of passion, and said these harsh words: 'The sons of the blind\\n\\n\\\"I have thus, O chief of men, told everything in thy presence.

Destroying all his sins like the maker of day destroying darkness, such a man, without doubt, sports in felicity in the region of Vishnu like Vishnu himself.\\\"\\n\\nThe End of the Svargarohanika-parva\\n\\nThe Eighteen parvas of the Mahabharata are thus complete\\n\\nSudras of his realm. Whatever wrongs were done to him by the sons of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, king Yudhishthira, forgot them all, and reverenced his\\n\\nuncle. If any man did anything that was not agreeable to the son of\\n\\nAmvika, he became thereby an object of hatred to the intelligent son of\\n\\nKunti. Indeed, through fear of Yudhishthira, nobody could talk of the\\n\\nevil deeds of either Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra. Both Gandhari and\\n\\nVidura also wore well pleased with the capacity the king Ajatasatru\\n\\nshowed for bearing wrongs. They were, however, not so pleased, O slayer\\n\\nof foes, with Bhima. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, was truly obedient to\\n\\nhis uncle. Bhima, however, at the sight of Dhritarashtra, became very\\n\\ncheerless. That slayer of foes, seeing Dharma's son reverencing the old\\n\\nking, reverenced him outwardly with a very unwilling heart.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart.

Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nproceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world). When the time again comes, it will come back into his hands. This foremost of bows, Gandiva, was procured by me from Varuna for the use of Partha. Let it be made over to Varuna himself.\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\nthat furious battle, the loss of the might of his arm, and the\\n\\nnon-appearance of his celestial weapons, Arjuna became greatly ashamed.\\n\\nThe Vrishni warriors including the foot-soldiers, the elephant-warriors,\\n\\nand the car-men, failed to rescue those Vrishni women that were being\\n\\nsnatched away by the robbers. The concourse was very large. The robbers\\n\\nassailed it at different points. Arjuna tried his best to protect it, but\\n\\ncould not succeed. In the very sightof all the warriors, many foremost of\\n\\nladies were dragged away, while others went away with the robbers of\\n\\ntheir own accord. The puissant Arjuna, supported by the servants of the\\n\\nVrishnis, struck the robbers with shafts sped from Gandiva. Soon,\\n\\nhowever. O king, his shafts were exhausted. In former days his shafts had\\n\\nbeen inexhaustible. Now, however, they proved otherwise. Finding his\\n\\nshafts exhausted, he became deeply afflicted with grief. The son of Indra\\n\\nVaishampayana said, \\\"Hear, O king, what the procedure is, and what the fruits, O Bharata, are that will spring from ones listening (to a recitation of the Bharata). Even this, O king of kings, is what thou askest me. The deities of Heaven, O ruler of Earth, came to this world for sport. Having achieved their task, they ascended once more to Heaven. Listen to what I shall tell thee in brief. In the Mahabharata is to be found the births of Rishis and deities on the Earth.

Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari are three prominent female characters who make important decisions and take actions that have far-reaching consequences.\\n\\nDraupadi is a strong and assertive character who is not afraid to speak her mind and stand up for herself. She is married to the five Pandava brothers, and her decision to do so shapes the course of the epic. Draupadi's rejection of Karna, based on his low caste, is an example of the rigid social hierarchy that exists in the Mahabharata. However, her decision also highlights her pride and stubbornness, which ultimately lead to negative consequences. Draupadi is also a symbol of feminine power and is involved in the decision-making process. Her role in binding the Pandavas together and her participation in the battle reflect the epic's view that women can be powerful and influential figures.\\n\\nKunti, the mother of the Pandavas, is a wise and compassionate character who serves as the final decision-maker for the Pandavas. Her guidance and leadership are crucial to the Pandavas' success, and her adherence to dharma is an example of the importance of moral values in the Mahabharata. Kunti's decision to send her son Arjuna to Draupadi's svayamvara (a ritual in which a bride chooses her groom) is an example of her strategic thinking and her desire to ensure the well-being of her sons.\\n\\nGandhari, the mother of the Kauravas, is a patriarchal figure who is often ignored and overlooked in the decision-making process. Her husband, Dhritarashtra, is the king, and the Kauravas follow a patriarchal structure that excludes women from decision-making roles. However, Gandhari's devotion to her sons and her adherence to dharma are admirable qualities that reflect the importance of moral values in the Mahabharata.\\n\\nThe Mahabharata's views on gender, power, and dharma are complex and multifaceted. While the epic reinforces traditional gender roles and social hierarchies, it also challenges them by portraying women as powerful and influential figures. The actions and choices of Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari reflect the epic's views on the importance of moral values, strategic thinking, and leadership. The epic suggests that both men and women have a role to play in decision-making and that a balanced approach that incorporates both masculine and feminine traits is necessary for achieving higher and sustainable goals.\\n\\nIn modern management, the teachings of Mahabharata provide valuable insights into effective leadership, decision-making, and strategic thinking. Lord Krishna, the main hero, is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager, and a good path maker. The epic exhibits our human value system and provides knowledge of management from various incidents.

Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nLessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nrisen from sleep. Kunti also shall behold Karna, and she of Yadu's race\\n\\nshall behold her son Abhimanyu. Draupadi shall behold her five sons, her\\n\\nsires, and her brothers also. Even before ye had asked me, this was the\\n\\nthought in my mind. I entertained this purpose when I was urged to that\\n\\neffect by the king, by thee, O Gandhari, and by Kunti. Thou shouldst not\\n\\ngrieve for those foremost of men. They met with death in consequence of\\n\\ntheir devotion to the established practices of Kshatriyas. O faultless\\n\\none, the work of the gods could not but be accomplished. It was for\\n\\naccomplishing that object that those heroes came down on Earth. They were\\n\\nall portions of the deities. Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Pisachas and\\n\\nGuhyakas and Rakshasas, many persons of great sanctity, many individuals\\n\\npersons in sacrifices and in obsequial rites, after the manner of all the\\n\\ngreat kings of antiquity. The high-minded son of Kunti is mild, and\\n\\nself-restrained, and is always disposed to spend as if he were a second\\n\\nVaisravana. He has great ministers that attend on him. He is\\n\\ncompassionate to even his foes. Indeed, that foremost one of Bharata's\\n\\nrace is of pure conduct. Endued with great intelligence, he is perfectly\\n\\nstraight-forward in his dealings and rules and protects us like a father\\n\\nprotecting his children. From association with him who is the son of\\n\\nDharma, O royal sage, Bhima and Arjuna and others will never do us the\\n\\nleast wrong. They are mild, O thou of Kuru's race, unto them that are\\n\\nmild, and fierce like snakes of virulent poison unto them that are\\n\\nfierce. Possessed of great energy, those high-souled ones are always\\n\\ndevoted to the good of the people. Neither Kunti, nor thy\\n\\n(daughter-in-law) Panchali, nor Ulupi, nor the princess of the Sattwata\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\na complexion as darkish as that of the blue lotus, she who sits there on\\n\\nthe earth, and whose eyes are as expansive as lotus-petals, is the wife\\n\\nof the eldest son of Madravati, This lady whose complexion is as fair as\\n\\nthat of heated gold and who sits with her child on her lap, is the\\n\\ndaughter of king Virata.

The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nthem in return according to due rites, the mighty-armed hero, accompanied\\n\\nby those princes, took rest like a ship-wrecked man tossed on the waves\\n\\nresting on reaching the shore.

Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me.

Installing Parikshit also on their throne, as king, the eldest brother of the Pandavas, filled with sorrow, addressed Subhadra, saying, This son of thy son will be the king of the Kurus. The survivor of the Yadus, Vajra, has been made a king. Parikshit will rule in Hastinapura, while the Yadava prince, Vajra, will rule in Shakraprastha. He should be protected by thee.

Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nseen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse\\n\\nkinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\nthat region, sacred to the deity of deities, O king, became exceedingly\\n\\ndelightful. Having performed the worship of Rudra and of all the Ganas,\\n\\nthe king, placing Vyasa ahead, proceeded towards the place where the\\n\\ntreasure was buried. Once more worshipping the Lord of treasures, and\\n\\nbowing unto him with reverence and saluting him properly, with diverse\\n\\nkinds of flowers and cakes and Krisara, having worshipped those foremost\\n\\nof gems, viz., Sankha and Nidhi, and those Yakshas who are the lords of\\n\\ngems, and having worshipped many foremost of Brahmanas and caused them to\\n\\nutter blessings, the king endued with great puissance, strengthened by\\n\\nthe energy and the auspicious benedictions of those Brahmanas, caused\\n\\nthat spot to be excavated. Then numerous vessels of diverse and\\n\\ndelightful forms, and Bhringaras and Katahas and Kalasas and\\n\\nBardhamanakas, and innumerable Bhajanas of beautiful forms, were dug out\\n\\nby king Yudhishthira the just. The wealth thus dug out was placed in\\n\\nfor the purpose of the safety of their palace. The weapons used in the war were very scientific. The modern technology used by the big business houses is based on these ancient scientific skills and knowledge. Moreover, corporate houses are able to use good infrastructure by conceiving the ideas from the history. Technology learnt today will certainly provide fruitful results. Thus, organizations must constantly improve their technology especially during the phase of growth. 3.2 Leadership Skills Centralized leadership may not give good and effective results. Corporate should concentrate on expanded management and decentralized leadership. They should restructure their teams to share management responsibilities. The sharing of responsibilities through decentralization will generate new ideas, innovative practices. This will help the team members to take responsibilities and grow higher. In addition organizations will earn more profits and achieve their goals in lesser time. In\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance.

Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreverence and informed him of the arrival of that foremost of men, viz.,\\n\\nPhalguna. On receipt of this intelligence, tears of joy covered the\\n\\nking's eyes. Large gifts were made to the messenger for the very\\n\\nagreeable tidings he had brought. On the second day from that date, a\\n\\nloud din was heard when that foremost of men, that chief of the Kurus,\\n\\ncame. The dust raised by the hoofs of that horse as it walked in close\\n\\nadjacence to Arjuna, looked as beautiful as that raised by the celestial\\n\\nsteed Uchchaisravas. And as Arjuna advanced he heard many gladdening\\n\\nwords uttered by the citizens. 'By good luck, O Partha, thou art out of\\n\\ndanger. Praise to you and king Yudhishthira! Who else than Arjuna could\\n\\ncome back after having caused the horse to wander over the whole Earth\\n\\nand after having vanquished all the kings in battle? We have not heard of\\n\\nsuch a feat having been achieved by even Sagara and other high-souled\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\nproceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world). When the time again comes, it will come back into his hands. This foremost of bows, Gandiva, was procured by me from Varuna for the use of Partha. Let it be made over to Varuna himself.\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\nintelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded\\n\\nArjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the\\n\\nTrigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in\\n\\nscorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the\\n\\nclatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then\\n\\nSuryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya\\n\\nwith hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who\\n\\nfollowed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction\\n\\nof Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire!

This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara.

Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nand every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war.

The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nKnow your competitors weakness and exploit it silently: Yudhisitira There is a reason why Yudhistira got that name \\u2013 he is always calm and composed in the battlefield (Yudh mein sthir = Yudhisthir) Yudhistir is an amazing strategist. On the first day of the war, he went over to the enemy side to seek blessings from Elders. In reality he made a covert deal with them, wherein all of them agreed to help him and unfolded the secrets of defeating them (Bheesma actually told Yudhistir how to stop him on the 9th day). He took calculated risks. He made an offer to all the assembled people to change sides if they wanted to. He knew well of the lack of cohesiveness among the Kauravas. Yuyutsu, son of Dhritarashtra crossed over to the Pandavas. This exposed the weakness of the Kauravas for all to see. Inference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently. Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women\\n\\nloyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded according to his contribution. This will encourage team members to work harder. Yudhishtra was asked by Yaksha to choose the life of one of his brothers. He had chosen Nakul at that time because his two brothers Bhima and Arjun were born to Kunti and other two Nakula and Sahadeva to his father\\u2019s second wife Madri. Since he is alive Kunti is partially bereaved. Life of Nakula would partially bereaved the Madri at that time. Yaksha was impressed with the impartial decision of Yudhishthra and granted the life of all of four brothers of Yudhishtra. 3.18 Motivation Motivation is key of success. Managers should motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight\\n\\ncontinuous practice. They focused on their goals. It was regular practice, dedication and commitment of Arjuna which made him powerful during war and he defeated great warriors of Kauravas. After the loss of their kingdom, Pandavas tried to work on their weaknesses and learned new skills. Arjuna utilized the time during their exile to acquire new weapons. Yudhishthra acquired teachings from various Rishis and learned the game of dice. Business promoters must experience their products and plans in order to survive in long run. They need to concentrate on continuous improvement for the success of business. 3.15 Women empowerment Women empowerment means participation of women in decision making. Participation of women in decision making helps to view the situation in holistic way. Harmonious, feminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed\\n\\nDrona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his superiority over Arjuna. Aswathama \\u2013 fighting to support his father Drona. Shakuni \\u2013 Favors Duryodhana but not interested in Hastinapur\\u2019s throne. His only interest is to spoonfeed Duryodhana in the battlefield. Pandavas were one team with one Goal. Everyone listened to Krishna\\u2019s strategies while as warriors they were in complete awe of Bhima and Arjuna. Most of them were close relatives \\u2013 cousins, brothers-in-law, fathers-in-law. More than that they all were part of the decision-making process. It was their \\u201ccommon\\u201d war. Inference: The strength lies in team work and not in individual efforts. Know your competitors weakness and exploit it silently: Yudhisitira There is a reason why Yudhistira got that name \\u2013 he is always calm and composed in the battlefield (Yudh mein sthir = Yudhisthir)\\n\\nviz., the Pandavas of wide chests. They said, 'We wish to know who\\n\\namongst these is Yudhishthira, who are Bhima and Arjuna, who the twins,\\n\\nand who is Draupadi of great fame.' Then the Suta, Sanjaya, in answer to\\n\\ntheir queries, pointed out to them the Pandavas. naming each, and\\n\\nDraupadi too as also the other ladies of the Kuru household.'\\n\\n\\\"Sanjaya said, 'This one that is as fair of complexion as pure gold, that\\n\\nis endued with a body which looks like that of a full-grown lion, that is\\n\\npossessed of a large aquiline nose, and wide and expansive eyes that are,\\n\\nagain, of a coppery hue, is the Kuru king. This one, whose tread\\n\\nresembles that of an infuriate elephant, whose complexion is as fair as\\n\\nthat of heated gold, whose frame is of large and expansive proportions\\n\\nand whose arms are long and stout, is Vrikodara. Behold him well! The\\n\\nmighty bowman who sits besides him, of darkish complexion and youthful\\n\\nframe, who resembles the leader of an elephantine herd, whose shoulders\\n\\nas the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip with such a glorious source of learning management principles. 3. MANAGEMENT LESSONS FROM MAHABHARATA The teachings from this great epic help us to understand the following management principles\\u2014 3.1 Scientific Skills and Technology From the ancient period of Mahabharata, technology and skill is being used by the Indians. The palace made by the Kauravas for the destruction of Pandavas was made of wax, which is highly inflammable material. It was not apparent from the outlook of the palace that it was made of wax. Even, in the palace of Pandavas, illusions were created to confuse the outsiders for the purpose of the safety of their palace. The weapons used in the war were very scientific. The modern technology used by the big business houses is based on these ancient scientific skills and\\n\\nInference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently. Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfor the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\nas before. Kunti, and Draupadi, and she of the Sattwata race, possessed\\n\\nof great fame, and Ulupi, the daughter of the snake chief, and queen\\n\\nChitrangada, and the sister of Dhrishtaketu, and the daughter of\\n\\nJarasandha,--these and many other ladies, O chief of men, used to wait\\n\\nupon the daughter of Suvala like maids of all work. That Dhritarashtra,\\n\\nwho was deprived of all his children, might not feel unhappy in any\\n\\nmatter, was what Yudhishthira often said unto his brothers to see. They\\n\\nalso, on their part, listening to these commands of grave import from\\n\\nking Yudhishthira, showed particular obedience to the old king. There was\\n\\none exception, however. It embraced Bhimasena. All that had followed from\\n\\nthat match at dice which had been brought about by the wicked\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma.

For example:\\n\\n* In the Bhishma Parva, Time is described as a fierce and destructive force that brings about the end of the Yadava dynasty, including the death of Krishna and the destruction of Dvaraka (Section 5, Verse 1-5).\\n* In the Drona Parva, Time is portrayed as a merciless force that brings about the downfall of the Kauravas, including the death of Drona and the destruction of the Kaurava army (Section 64, Verse 1-10).\\n* In the Karna Parva, Time is depicted as a destroyer that brings about the end of Karna's life, despite his valiant efforts to resist it (Section 64, Verse 1-10).\\n\\n**Preserver:**\\n\\nTime is also depicted as a preserver, maintaining the balance and order of the universe. For example:\\n\\n* In the Adi Parva, Time is described as a gentle and benevolent force that brings about the birth and growth of new life, including the birth of the Pandavas and the Kauravas (Section 1, Verse 1-10).\\n* In the Sabha Parva, Time is portrayed as a preserver that maintains the balance of the universe, ensuring that the forces of good and evil are kept in check (Section 1, Verse 1-10).\\n* In the Udyoga Parva, Time is depicted as a preserver that brings about the reunion of the Pandavas and their allies, allowing them to prepare for the impending war (Section 1, Verse 1-10).\\n\\n**Cyclical Nature:**\\n\\nThe Mahabharata portrays Time as a cyclical force, with events repeating themselves in a never-ending cycle of birth, growth, decay, and rebirth.

Behold the perverse course of Time. 500,000\\n\\nmighty-armed warriors have thus been laid low. Encountering one another,\\n\\nthey have met with destruction. Thinking repeatedly of this carnage of\\n\\nthe Yadava warriors of immeasurable energy and of the illustrious\\n\\nKrishna, I fail to derive peace of mind. The death of the wielder of\\n\\nSarnga is as incredible as the drying up of the ocean, the displacement\\n\\nof a mountain, the falling down of the vault of heaven, or the cooling\\n\\nproperty of fire. Deprived of the company of the Vrishni heroes, I desire\\n\\nnot to live in this world. Another incident has happened that is more\\n\\npainful than this, O thou that art possessed of wealth of penances.\\n\\nRepeatedly thinking of it, my heart is breaking. In my very sight, O\\n\\nBrahmana, thousands of Vrishni ladies were carried away by the Abhiras of\\n\\nobsequies, as also of king Somadatta and of Bhurisravas, of the royal\\n\\nsage Valhika, and of the high-souled Drona, and of all others.

How hast thou\\n\\nbeen able to forget that anxiety of twelve long years, and our residence\\n\\nin deep incognito that was so painful to Draupadi? Where was\\n\\nDhritarashtra's affection for us then? Clad in a black deer-skin and\\n\\ndivested of all thy ornaments, with the princess of Panchala in thy\\n\\ncompany, didst thou not follow this king?

Thy\\n\\n\\\"Thus addressed, that royal sage, viz., thy grandsire, proceeded with Dharma and all the other gods. Having bathed in the celestial river Ganga, sacred and sanctifying and ever adored by the Rishis, he cast off his human body. Assuming then a celestial form, king Yudhishthira the just, in consequence of that bath, became divested of all his enmities and grief. Surrounded by the deities, the Kuru king Yudhishthira then proceeded from that spot. He was accompanied by Dharma, and the great Rishis uttered his praises. Indeed, he reached that place where those foremost of men, those heroes, viz., the Pandavas and the Dhartarashtras, freed from (human) wrath, were enjoying each his respective status.\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\\"Upon the conclusion of all the Parvas, the house-holder of wisdom should give unto the reciter a copy of the Mahabharata with a piece of gold. When the Harivansa Parva is being recited, Brahmanas should be fed with frumenty at each successive Parana, O king. Having finished all the Parvas, one versed in the scriptures, robing himself in white, wearing garlands, decked with ornaments, and properly purified, should place a copy of the Mahabharata on an auspicious spot and cover it with a piece of silken cloth and worship it, according to due rites, with scents and garlands, offering each at a time. Indeed, O king, the several volumes of this treatise should be worshipped by one with devotion and concentrated mind. Offerings should be made unto them of diverse kinds of food and garlands and drinks and diverse auspicious articles of enjoyment. Gold and other precious metals should be given as Dakshina. The names should then be taken of all the deities as also of Nara and Narayana. Then,\\n\\nfame saw all her children as also all that had been slain in battle. All\\n\\npersons assembled there beheld with steadfast gaze and hearts filled with\\n\\nwonder that amazing and inconceivable phenomenon which made the hair on\\n\\ntheir bodies stand on its end. It looked like a high carnival of\\n\\ngladdened men and women. That wondrous scene looked like a picture\\n\\npainted on the canvas. Dhritarashtra, beholding all those heroes, with\\n\\nhis celestial vision obtained through the grace of that sage, became full\\n\\nof joy, O chief of Bharata's race.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XXXIII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'Then those foremost of men divested of wrath and\\n\\njealousy, and cleansed of every sin, met with one another, agreeably to\\n\\nthose high and auspicious ordinances that have been laid down by\\n\\nregenerate Rishis. All of them were happy of hearts and looked like gods\\n\\nmoving in Heaven. Son met with sire or mother, wives with husbands,\\n\\nbrother with brother, and friend with friend, O king. The Pandavas, full\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nmade the fifteenth by Rahu once more. Such a day had happened at the time\\n\\nof the great battle of the Bharatas. It has once more appeared, it seems,\\n\\nfor our destruction. \\\"The slayer of Keshi, Janardana, thinking upon the\\n\\nomens that Time showed, understood that the thirty-sixth year had come,\\n\\nand that what Gandhari, burning with grief on account of the death of her\\n\\nsons, and deprived of all her kinsmen, had said was about to transpire.\\n\\nThe present is exactly similar to that time when Yudhishthira noted at\\n\\nsuch awful omens when the two armies had been arrayed in order of battle.\\n\\nVasudeva, having said so, endeavoured to bring about those occurrences\\n\\nwhich would make Gandharis words true. That chastiser of foes commanded\\n\\nthe Vrishnis to make a pilgrimage to some sacred water. The messengers\\n\\nanother in that fearful melee. Indeed, O king, whoever amongst them took\\n\\nup in wrath a few blades of the Eraka grass, these, in his hands, became\\n\\nsoon converted into a thunderbolt, O puissant one. Every blade of grass\\n\\nthere was seen to be converted into a terrible iron bolt. All this, know,\\n\\nO king, was due to the curse denounced by Brahmanas. He who hurled a\\n\\nblade of grass saw that it pierced through even such things as were\\n\\nutterly impenetrable. In fact, every blade was seen to become a terrible\\n\\nbolt having the force of thunder. Son killed sire, and sire killed son, O\\n\\nBharata. Inebriated with wine, they rushed and fell upon one another. The\\n\\nKukuras and the Andhakas met with destruction like insects rushing at a\\n\\nblazing fire. As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them\\n\\nthought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had\\n\\ncome, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything. Indeed,\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. Empathy\\n\\nmen took up their abode as pleased them. The king possessed of great\\n\\nintelligence, with the Pandavas, took up his abode in a desirable spot,\\n\\nalong with the ladies and the aged ones of his household. They passed\\n\\nthat day as if it were a whole year, waiting for the advent of the night\\n\\nwhen they would behold the deceased princes. The Sun then reached the\\n\\nsacred mountain in the west and all those persons, having bathed in the\\n\\nsacred stream, finished their evening rites.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XXXII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'When night came, all those persons, having finished\\n\\ntheir evening rites, approached Vyasa. Dhritarashtra of righteous soul,\\n\\nwith purified body and with mind solely directed towards it, sat there\\n\\nwith the Pandavas and the Rishis in his company. The ladies of the royal\\n\\nhousehold sat with Gandhari in a secluded spot. All the citizens and the\\n\\ninhabitants of the provinces ranged themselves according to their years.\\n\\nSauti said: Thus questioned, that regenerate Rishi, receiving the permission of the high-souled Vyasa, set himself to answer the question of the king.\\n\\nVaishampayana said, \\\"Every one, O king of men, is not capable of returning to his own nature at the end of his deeds. Whether this is so or not, is, indeed a good question asked by thee. Hear, O king, this which is a mystery of the gods, O chief of Bharatas race. It was explained (to us) by Vyasa of mighty energy, celestial vision and great prowess, that ancient ascetic, O Kauravya, who is the son of Parasara and who always observes high vows, who is of immeasurable understanding, who is omniscient, and who, therefore knows the end attached to all acts.\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\nseen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse\\n\\nkinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nalleged against thee and thy son. Regarding what thou hast said about\\n\\nDuryodhana in the matter of this carnage of kinsmen, I beg thee, O\\n\\ndelighter of the Kurus (to listen to me).'\\n\\n\\\"The Brahmana continued, 'The destruction that has overtaken the Kurus\\n\\nwas not brought about by Duryodhana. It was not brought about by thee.\\n\\nNor was it brought about by Karna and Suvala's son. We know that it was\\n\\nbrought about by destiny, and that it was incapable of being\\n\\ncounteracted. Verily, destiny is not capable of being resisted by human\\n\\nexertion. Eight and ten Akshauhinis of troops, O monarch, were brought\\n\\ntogether. In eight and ten days that host was destroyed by the foremost\\n\\nof Kuru warriors, viz., Bhishma and Drona and Kripa and others, and the\\n\\nhigh-souled Karna, and the heroic Yuyudhana, and Dhrishtadyumna, and by\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins.

When the time came for erecting the\\n\\nsacrificial stake, O chief of Bharata's race, six stakes were set up that\\n\\nwere made of Vilwa,[209] six that were made of Khadira, and six that were\\n\\nmade of Saravarnin. Two stakes were get up by the priests that were made\\n\\nof Devadaru in that sacrifice of the Kuru king, and one that was made of\\n\\nSleshmataka. At the command of the king, Bhima caused some other stakes\\n\\nto be set up, for the sake of beauty only, that were made of gold.\\n\\nAdorned with fine cloths supplied by the royal sage, those stakes shone\\n\\nthere like Indra and the deities with the seven celestial Rishis standing\\n\\naround them in Heaven. A number of golden bricks were made for\\n\\nconstructing therewith a Chayana. The Chayana made resembled in beauty\\n\\nthat which had been made for Daksha, the lord of creatures (on the\\n\\noccasion of his great sacrifice). The Chayana measured eight and ten\\n\\nthy brother. The learned know him to be Dharma in consequence of his\\n\\npractices of Dharana and Dhyana.[46] He grows with (the growth of) truth,\\n\\nself-restraint, tranquillity of heart, compassion, and gifts. He is\\n\\nalways engaged in penances, and is eternal. From that deity of\\n\\nRighteousness, through Yoga-puissance, the Kuru king Yudhishthira also\\n\\ntook his birth. Yudhishthira, therefore, O king, is Dharma of great\\n\\nwisdom and immeasurable intelligence. Dharma exists both here and\\n\\nhereafter, and is like fire or wind or water or earth or space.

He is capable of being beheld by only those that are the\\n\\nforemost of the deities and those that are cleansed of every sin and\\n\\ncrowned with ascetic success.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata in several ways:\\n\\n1. **Duty over personal desire**: Bhishma's vow of celibacy is a self-imposed duty that he chooses to follow, even though it means giving up his personal desire for a family and children. This reflects the importance of duty and responsibility in the Mahabharata, where individuals are expected to prioritize their obligations to their family, community, and society over their personal desires.\\n2. **Devotion to family**: Bhishma's devotion to his father's happiness is a key aspect of his character. He is willing to sacrifice his own desires and well-being for the sake of his father, which reflects the importance of family ties and loyalty in the Mahabharata.\\n3. **Consequences of prioritizing duty**: However, Bhishma's decision to prioritize his duty over his personal desire ultimately leads to negative consequences. His vow of celibacy means that he is unable to produce an heir, which leads to a succession crisis in the kingdom. This reflects the idea that prioritizing duty over personal desire can have unintended consequences and may not always lead to the desired outcome.\\n4. **Tension between duty and personal desire**: The story of Bhishma's vow of celibacy highlights the tension between duty and personal desire in the Mahabharata. While duty is an important aspect of the epic, personal desire and individual happiness are also valued. The story suggests that individuals must navigate this tension and find a balance between their duties and personal desires.\\n\\nOverall, Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata, highlighting the importance of duty, family ties, and loyalty, while also acknowledging the tension between duty and personal desire.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"Lessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life.

His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child.

But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\n\\\"Then Yudhishthira once more summoned all his subjects. The royal sage informed them of his intentions. The citizens and the inhabitants of the provinces, hearing the kings words, became filled with anxiety and disapproved of them. This should never be done, said they unto the king. The monarch, well versed with the changes brought about by time, did not listen to their counsels. Possessed of righteous soul, he persuaded the people to sanction his views. He then set his heart on leaving the world. His brothers also formed the same resolution. Then Dharmas son, Yudhishthira, the king of the Kurus, casting off his ornaments, wore barks of trees. Bhima and Arjuna and the twins, and Draupadi also of great fame, similarly clad themselves in bark of trees, O king. Having caused the preliminary rites of religion, O chief of Bharatas race, which were to bless them in the accomplishment of their design, those foremost of men cast off their sacred fires into the water. The ladies, beholding the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nSECTION XXVI\\n\\n\\\"Dhritarashtra said. 'O Yudhishthira, art thou in peace and happiness,\\n\\nwith all thy brothers and the inhabitants of the city and the provinces?\\n\\nAre they that live in dependance on thee also happy? Are they ministers,\\n\\nand servitors, and all thy seniors and preceptors also, happy? Are those\\n\\nalso that live in thy dominions free from fear? Dost thou follow the old\\n\\nand traditional conduct of rulers of men? Is thy treasury filled without\\n\\ndisregarding the restraints imposed by justice and equity? Dost thou\\n\\nbehave as thou shouldst towards foes, neutrals, and allies? Dost thou\\n\\nduly look after the Brahmanas, always making them the first gifts\\n\\n(ordained in sacrifices and religious rites)? What need I say of the\\n\\ncitizens, and thy servants, and kinsmen,--are they foes, O chief of\\n\\nBharata's race, gratified with thy behaviour? Dost thou, O king of kings,\\n\\nadore with devotion the Pitris and the deities? Dost thou worship guests\\n\\nthat belongs to him. Bhima, however, of mighty arms, recollecting all his\\n\\ninnumerable sorrows, has with difficulty given his consent, breathing\\n\\nmany heavy sighs. That mighty-armed hero, O monarch, was solicited by the\\n\\nrighteous king as also by Vibhatsu, and induced to assume relations of\\n\\ncordiality towards thee. King Yudhishthira the just, his prayed thee not\\n\\nto give way to dissatisfaction for the improper conduct which Bhima has\\n\\ndisplayed at the recollection of former hostilities. This is generally\\n\\nthe behaviour of Kshatriyas in battle, O king, and this Vrikodara is\\n\\ndevoted to battle and the practices of Kshatriyas. Both myself and\\n\\nArjuna, O king, repeatedly beg thee for pardoning Vrikodara. Be gracious\\n\\nunto us. Thou art our lord. Whatever wealth we have, thou mayst give away\\n\\nas thou likest, O ruler of Earth. Thou, O Bharata. art the Master of this\\n\\nkingdom and of all lives in it. Let the foremost one of Kuru's race give\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. Empathy\\n\\nonly the Vrishnis I wish to live. My desire of life, however, is due to\\n\\nmy wish of acquiring merit and not wealth or enjoyment. Do thou cast\\n\\nauspicious looks upon us all. To obtain thy sight will be difficult for\\n\\nus. The king will commence to practise the most austere and unbearable of\\n\\npenances.' Hearing these words, that lord of battle, the mighty-armed\\n\\nSahadeva, with eyes bathed in tears, addressed Yudhishthira, saying,--'O\\n\\nchief of Bharata's race, I dare not leave my mother. Do thou return to\\n\\nthe capital soon. I shall practise penances, O puissant one. Even here I\\n\\nshall emaciate my body by penances, engaged in serving the feet of the\\n\\nking and of these my mothers.' Unto that mighty-armed hero, Kunti, after\\n\\nan embrace, said--'Depart, O son. Do not say so. Do my bidding. Do all of\\n\\nyou go hence. Let peace be yours. Ye sons, let happiness be yours. By\\n\\nyour stay here, our penances will be obstructed. Bound by the ties of my\\n\\n(King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do not ask for what you can\\u2019t manage \\u2013 Draupadi Draupadi had done ghor tapasya and asked for a husband with 14 qualities. Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow. Note that Draupadi rejected Karna on the ground of low caste. Karna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nSudras of his realm. Whatever wrongs were done to him by the sons of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, king Yudhishthira, forgot them all, and reverenced his\\n\\nuncle. If any man did anything that was not agreeable to the son of\\n\\nAmvika, he became thereby an object of hatred to the intelligent son of\\n\\nKunti. Indeed, through fear of Yudhishthira, nobody could talk of the\\n\\nevil deeds of either Duryodhana or Dhritarashtra. Both Gandhari and\\n\\nVidura also wore well pleased with the capacity the king Ajatasatru\\n\\nshowed for bearing wrongs. They were, however, not so pleased, O slayer\\n\\nof foes, with Bhima. Dharma's son, Yudhishthira, was truly obedient to\\n\\nhis uncle. Bhima, however, at the sight of Dhritarashtra, became very\\n\\ncheerless. That slayer of foes, seeing Dharma's son reverencing the old\\n\\nking, reverenced him outwardly with a very unwilling heart.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\"]}": {

Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nwas Dhritarashtra's son by his Vaisya wife, used to wait upon\\n\\nDhritarashtra. The Pandavas used to take the opinion of that king in all\\n\\nmatters. Indeed, for ten and five years, they did all things under the\\n\\nadvice of the old king. Those heroes used very often to go to that\\n\\nmonarch and sit beside him, after having worshipped his feet, agreeably\\n\\nto the wishes of king Yudhishthira the just. They did all things under\\n\\nthe command of Dhritarashtra who smelt their heads in affection. The\\n\\ndaughter of king Kuntibhoja also obeyed Gandhari in everything. Draupadi\\n\\nand Subhadra and the other ladies of the Pandavas behaved towards the old\\n\\nking and the queen as if they were their own father-in-law and\\n\\nmother-in-law. Costly beds and robes and ornaments, and food and drink\\n\\nand other enjoyable articles, in profusion and of such superior kinds as\\n\\nwere worthy of royal use, were presented by king Yudhishthira unto\\n\\nDhritarashtra. Similarly Kunti behaved towards Gandhari as towards a\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\na complexion as darkish as that of the blue lotus, she who sits there on\\n\\nthe earth, and whose eyes are as expansive as lotus-petals, is the wife\\n\\nof the eldest son of Madravati, This lady whose complexion is as fair as\\n\\nthat of heated gold and who sits with her child on her lap, is the\\n\\ndaughter of king Virata. She is the wife of that Abhimanyu who, while\\n\\ndivested of his car, was slain by Drona and others fighting from their\\n\\ncars.[41] These ladies, the hair on whose heads shows not the parted\\n\\nline, and who are clad in white, are the widows of the slain sons of\\n\\nDhritarashtra. They are the daughters-in-law of this old king, the wives\\n\\nof his hundred sons, now deprived of both their husbands and children who\\n\\nhave been slain by heroic foes. I have now pointed them out in the order\\n\\nof precedence. In consequence of their devotion to Brahmanas, their\\n\\nunderstandings and hearts are divested of every kind of crookedness.\\n\\nLessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\nwere checked in battle,--heroes that were equal to Indra himself in\\n\\nmight--why would not he ascend to Heaven? O irresistible one, do thou\\n\\nkill this grief of thine. Do not suffer thyself to be swayed by wrath.\\n\\nThat conqueror of hostile cities has attained in that sanctified goal\\n\\nwhich depends upon death at the edge of weapons. After the fall of that\\n\\nhero, this my sister Subhadra stricken with grief, indulged in loud\\n\\nlamentations, when she saw Kunti, like a female ospray. When she met\\n\\nDraupadi, she asked her in grief,--O reverend lady, where are all our\\n\\nsons? I desire to behold them. Hearing her lamentations, all the Kaurava\\n\\nladies embraced her and wept sitting around her. Beholding (her\\n\\ndaughter-in-law) Uttara, she said,--'O blessed girl, where has thy\\n\\nhusband gone? When he comes back, do thou, without losing a moment,\\n\\napprise me of it. Alas, O daughter of Virata, as soon he heard my voice,\\n\\nhe used to come out of his chamber without the loss of a moment. Why does\\n\\nseen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse\\n\\nkinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nthat region, sacred to the deity of deities, O king, became exceedingly\\n\\ndelightful. Having performed the worship of Rudra and of all the Ganas,\\n\\nthe king, placing Vyasa ahead, proceeded towards the place where the\\n\\ntreasure was buried. Once more worshipping the Lord of treasures, and\\n\\nbowing unto him with reverence and saluting him properly, with diverse\\n\\nkinds of flowers and cakes and Krisara, having worshipped those foremost\\n\\nof gems, viz., Sankha and Nidhi, and those Yakshas who are the lords of\\n\\ngems, and having worshipped many foremost of Brahmanas and caused them to\\n\\nutter blessings, the king endued with great puissance, strengthened by\\n\\nthe energy and the auspicious benedictions of those Brahmanas, caused\\n\\nthat spot to be excavated. Then numerous vessels of diverse and\\n\\ndelightful forms, and Bhringaras and Katahas and Kalasas and\\n\\nBardhamanakas, and innumerable Bhajanas of beautiful forms, were dug out\\n\\nby king Yudhishthira the just. The wealth thus dug out was placed in\\n\\nfor the purpose of the safety of their palace. The weapons used in the war were very scientific. The modern technology used by the big business houses is based on these ancient scientific skills and knowledge. Moreover, corporate houses are able to use good infrastructure by conceiving the ideas from the history. Technology learnt today will certainly provide fruitful results. Thus, organizations must constantly improve their technology especially during the phase of growth. 3.2 Leadership Skills Centralized leadership may not give good and effective results. Corporate should concentrate on expanded management and decentralized leadership. They should restructure their teams to share management responsibilities. The sharing of responsibilities through decentralization will generate new ideas, innovative practices. This will help the team members to take responsibilities and grow higher. In addition organizations will earn more profits and achieve their goals in lesser time. In\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n6\\n\\nJanamejaya said, \\\"O holy one, according to what rites should the learned listen to the Bharata? What are the fruits (acquirable by hearing it)? What deities are to be worshipped during the several paranas? What should be the gifts that one should make, O holy one, at every parva or sacred day (during the continuance of the recitation)? What should be the qualification of the reciter to be engaged? Tell me all this!\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nrisen from sleep. Kunti also shall behold Karna, and she of Yadu's race\\n\\nshall behold her son Abhimanyu. Draupadi shall behold her five sons, her\\n\\nsires, and her brothers also. Even before ye had asked me, this was the\\n\\nthought in my mind. I entertained this purpose when I was urged to that\\n\\neffect by the king, by thee, O Gandhari, and by Kunti. Thou shouldst not\\n\\ngrieve for those foremost of men. They met with death in consequence of\\n\\ntheir devotion to the established practices of Kshatriyas. O faultless\\n\\none, the work of the gods could not but be accomplished. It was for\\n\\naccomplishing that object that those heroes came down on Earth. They were\\n\\nall portions of the deities. Gandharvas and Apsaras, and Pisachas and\\n\\nGuhyakas and Rakshasas, many persons of great sanctity, many individuals\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nthem in return according to due rites, the mighty-armed hero, accompanied\\n\\nby those princes, took rest like a ship-wrecked man tossed on the waves\\n\\nresting on reaching the shore. Meanwhile king Vabhruvahan of great\\n\\nwisdom, accompanied by his mothers (Chitrangada and Ulupi), came to the\\n\\nKuru capital. The mighty-armed prince duly saluted all his seniors of\\n\\nKuru's race and the other kings present there, and was honoured by them\\n\\nall in return. He then entered the excellent abode of his grand-mother\\n\\nKunti.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION LXXXVIII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'Entering the palace of the Pandavas the mighty-armed\\n\\nprince saluted his grand-mother in soothing and sweet accents. Then queen\\n\\nChitrangada, and (Ulupi) the daughter of (the snake) Kauravya, together\\n\\napproached Partha and Krishna with humility. They then met Subhadra and\\n\\nthe other ladies of the Kuru race with due formalities. Kunti gave them\\n\\nmany gems and costly things. Draupadi and Subhadra and the other ladies\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. Empathy\\n\\nthe other ladies of the Kuru race with due formalities. Kunti gave them\\n\\nmany gems and costly things. Draupadi and Subhadra and the other ladies\\n\\nof Kuru's race all made presents to them. The two ladies took up their\\n\\nresidence there, using costly beds and seats, treated with affection and\\n\\nrespect by Kunti herself from desire of doing what was agreeable to\\n\\nPartha. King Vabhruvahana of great energy, duly honoured (by Kunti), then\\n\\nmet Dhritarashtra according to due rites. Repairing then to king\\n\\nYudhishthira and Bhima and the other Pandavas, the mighty prince of\\n\\nManipura saluted them all with humility. They all embraced him with great\\n\\naffection and honoured him duly. And those mighty car-warriors highly\\n\\ngratified with him, made large gifts of wealth unto him. The king of\\n\\nManipura then humbly approached Krishna, that hero armed with the discus\\n\\nand the mace, like a second Pradyumna approaching his sire. Krishna gave\\n\\nknow what the cause is that has brought out the ladies.' The intelligent\\n\\nruler of Manipura, thug questioned by Dhananjaya, gratified him by\\n\\nbending his head in reverence, and then said,--'Let Ulupi be questioned.'\\n\\nSECTION LXXXI\\n\\n\\\"Arjuna said, 'What business brought thee here, O daughter (-in-law) of\\n\\nKuru's race, and what also is the cause of the arrival on the field of\\n\\nbattle of her who is the mother of the ruler of Manipura?

Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity. The deities are possessed of (Yoga) puissance.\\n\\nThey are able to penetrate human bodies.[48] There are deities. They\\n\\nbeget (offspring) by thought alone. By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nagainst Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\ntoo, who had been discomfited before (by the Pandavas on the field of\\n\\nKurukshetra), and many Aryan kings, possessed of soldiers and animals\\n\\nendued with great alacrity, and all irresistible in fight encountered the\\n\\nson of Pandu in battle. Thus occurred innumerable battles in diverse\\n\\ncountries, O monarch, between Arjuna and the rulers of diverse realms who\\n\\ncame to encounter him. I shall, O sinless king, narrate to thee those\\n\\nbattles only which raged with great fury and which were the principal\\n\\nones among all he fought.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXIV\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said. 'A battle took place between the diadem-decked\\n\\n(Arjuna) and the sons and grandsons of the Trigartas whose hostility the\\n\\nPandavas has incurred before and all of whom were well-known as mighty\\n\\ncar-warriors. Having learnt that that foremost of steeds, which was\\n\\nintended for the sacrifice, had come to their realm, these heroes, casing\\n\\nthemselves in mail, surrounded Arjuna. Mounted on their cars, drawn by\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nArjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.\\n\\nEquipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake\\n\\npenetrating on an anthill. Piercing the son of Kunti through, the shaft\\n\\nwent deep into the Earth. Feeling acute pain, the intelligent Dhananjaya\\n\\nrested awhile, supporting himself on his excellent bow. He stood, having\\n\\nrecourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like\\n\\none deprived of life. That foremost of men, then regaining consciousness,\\n\\npraised his son highly. Possessed of great splendour, the son of Sakra\\n\\nsaid, 'Excellent, Excellent, O mighty-armed one, O son of Chitrangada! O\\n\\nson, beholding this feat, so worthy of thee, I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I shall now shoot these arrows at thee, O son. Stand for fight\\n\\n(without running away).' Having said these words, that slayer of foes\\n\\nshot a shower of arrows on the prince. King Vabhruvahana, however, with\\n\\nKettle-drums struck by nobody, produced their music deep as the roar of\\n\\nthe cloud. A loud uproar was heard in the welkin consisting of the\\n\\nwords--Excellent, Excellent! The mighty-armed Dhananjaya, rising up and\\n\\nwell-comforted, embraced Vabhruvahana and smelled his head. He saw\\n\\nsitting at a distance from his son, this latter's mother afflicted with\\n\\ngrief, in the company of Ulupi. Dhananjaya asked,--'Why is it that every\\n\\nthing in the field of battle seems to bear the indications of grief,\\n\\nwonder, and joy? If, O slayer of foes, the cause is known to thee, do\\n\\nthou then tell me. Why has thy mother come to the field of battle? Why\\n\\nalso has Ulupi, the daughter of the prince of snakes, come here? I know\\n\\nthat thou hadst fought this battle with me at my own command. I desire to\\n\\nknow what the cause is that has brought out the ladies.' The intelligent\\n\\nruler of Manipura, thug questioned by Dhananjaya, gratified him by\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars. Bheesma is fighting for his vow of protecting the throne Drona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. Empathy\\n\\nheroes were in gravity like the ocean, yet they were now deprived of\\n\\ntheir knowledge and their very senses by the grief they felt. Thinking of\\n\\ntheir mother, the sons of Pandu were filled with anxiety as to how their\\n\\nemaciated mother was serving the old couple. 'How, indeed, is that king,\\n\\nwhose sons have all been slain and who is without refuge, living alone,\\n\\nwith only his wife, in the woods that are the haunt of beasts of prey?\\n\\nAlas, how does that highly blessed queen, Gandhari, whose dear ones have\\n\\nall been slain, follow her blind lord in the solitary woods?'--Even such\\n\\nwas the anxiety manifested by the Pandavas when they talked with one\\n\\nanother. They then set their hearts upon seeing the king in his forest\\n\\nretreat. Then Sahadeva, bowing down to the king, said, 'I see thy heart\\n\\nto be set upon seeing our sire. From my respect for thee, however, I\\n\\ncould not speedily open my mouth on the subject of our journey to the\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nwith that arrowy shower, Arjuna looked like the sun covered by a cloud.\\n\\nThat foremost son of Pandu, in the midst of that cloud of arrows,\\n\\nresembled a bird in the midst of an iron cage, O Bharata. Seeing the son\\n\\nof Kunti thus afflicted with shafts, cries of Oh and Alas were uttered by\\n\\nthe three worlds and the Sun himself became shorn of his splendour. Then,\\n\\nO king, a terrible wind began to blow, and Rahu swallowed up both the Sun\\n\\nand the Moon at the same time. Many meteors struck the solar disc and\\n\\nthen shot in different directions. The prince of mountains, viz.,\\n\\nKailasa, began to tremble. The seven (celestial) Rishis, as also the\\n\\nother Rishis of Heaven, penetrated with fear, and afflicted with grief\\n\\nand sorrow, breathed hot sighs. Piercing through the welkin, those\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\n\\\"At this, all the brothers urged Dhananjaya to do what the deity said. He then threw into the waters (of the sea) both the bow and the couple of inexhaustible quivers. After this, O chief of Bharatas race, the god of the fire disappeared then and there. The heroic sons of Pandu next proceeded with their faces turned towards the south. Then, by the northern coast of the salt sea, those princes of Bharatas race proceeded to the south-west. Turning next towards the west, they beheld the city of Dwaraka covered by the ocean. Turning next to the north, those foremost ones proceeded on. Observant of Yoga, they were desirous of making a round of the whole Earth.\\\"\\n\\nSECTION\\n\\n2\\n\\nthy foes are that are bent on finding out thy laches, thou shouldst,\\n\\nthrough trusted agents, cause them to be destroyed from a distance.\\n\\nExamining their conduct, thou shouldst O perpetuator of Kuru's race,\\n\\nappoint thy servants. Thou shouldst cause all thy acts to be accomplished\\n\\nthrough thy servitors: whether they are appointed for those acts or not.\\n\\nThe commandant of thy forces should be of firm conduct, courageous,\\n\\ncapable of bearing hardships, loyal, and devoted to thy good. Artisans\\n\\nand mechanics, O son of Pandu, dwelling in thy provinces, should always\\n\\ndo thy acts like kine and asses.[11] Thou shouldst always, O\\n\\nYudhishthira, be careful to ascertain thy own laches as also those of thy\\n\\nfoes. The laches also of thy own men as also of the men of thy foes\\n\\nshould equally be ascertained. Those men of thy kingdom, that are well\\n\\nskilled in their respective vocations, and are devoted to thy good,\\n\\nshould be favoured by thee with adequate means of support. A wise king, O\\n\\nDrona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his superiority over Arjuna. Aswathama \\u2013 fighting to support his father Drona. Shakuni \\u2013 Favors Duryodhana but not interested in Hastinapur\\u2019s throne. His only interest is to spoonfeed Duryodhana in the battlefield. Pandavas were one team with one Goal. Everyone listened to Krishna\\u2019s strategies while as warriors they were in complete awe of Bhima and Arjuna. Most of them were close relatives \\u2013 cousins, brothers-in-law, fathers-in-law. More than that they all were part of the decision-making process. It was their \\u201ccommon\\u201d war. Inference: The strength lies in team work and not in individual efforts. Know your competitors weakness and exploit it silently: Yudhisitira There is a reason why Yudhistira got that name \\u2013 he is always calm and composed in the battlefield (Yudh mein sthir = Yudhisthir)\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\\n\\nKetuvarman, the younger brother of Suryavarman, and possessed of youthful\\n\\nvigour, fought, for the sake of his brother, against Pandu's son\\n\\npossessed of great fame. Beholding Ketuvarman approaching towards him for\\n\\nbattle, Vibhatsu, that slayer of hostile heroes, slew him with many\\n\\nsharp-pointed arrows. Upon Ketuvarman's fall, the mighty car-warrior\\n\\nDhritavarman, rushing on his car towards Arjuna, showered a perfect\\n\\ndownpour of arrows on him. Beholding that lightness of hand displayed by\\n\\nthe youth Dhritavarman, Gudakesa of mighty energy and great prowess\\n\\nbecame highly gratified with him. The son of Indra could not see when the\\n\\nyoung warrior took out his arrows and when he placed them on his\\n\\nbow-string aiming at him. He only saw showers of arrows in the air. For a\\n\\nbrief space of time, Arjuna gladdened his enemy and mentally admired his\\n\\nSECTION III\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The people who lived in the Kuru kingdom failed to\\n\\nnotice any variance in the cordiality that subsisted between king\\n\\nYudhishthira and the father of Duryodhana. When the Kuru king recollected\\n\\nhis wicked son, he then could not but feel unfriendly, in his heart,\\n\\ntowards Bhima. Bhimasena also, O king, impelled by a heart that seemed to\\n\\nbe wicked, was unable to put up with king Dhritarashtra. Vrikodara\\n\\nsecretly did many acts that were disagreeable to the old king. Through\\n\\ndeceitful servitors he caused the commands of his uncle to be disobeyed.\\n\\nRecollecting the evil counsels of the old king and some acts of his,\\n\\nBhima, one day, in the midst of his friends, slapped his armpits, in the\\n\\nhearing of Dhritarashtra and of Gandhari. The wrathful Vrikodara,\\n\\nrecollecting his foes Duryodhana and Karna and Dussasana, gave way to a\\n\\ntransport of passion, and said these harsh words: 'The sons of the blind\\n\\nthat set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions. That foremost of\\n\\ncar-warriors, that conqueror of hostile towns, the son of Pritha,\\n\\nescorted this vast procession of Vrishnis, which still abounded with\\n\\nwealth, and which looked like a veritable ocean.\\n\\n\\\"After all the people had set out, the ocean, that home of sharks and\\n\\nalligators, flooded Dvaraka, which still teemed with wealth of every\\n\\nkind, with its waters. Whatever portion of the ground was passed over,\\n\\nocean immediately flooded over with his waters. Beholding this wonderful\\n\\nsight, the inhabitants of Dvaraka walked faster and faster, saying,\\n\\nWonderful is the course of fate! Dhananjaya, after abandoning Dvaraka,\\n\\nproceeded by slow marches, causing the Vrishni women to rest in pleasant\\n\\nforests and mountains and by the sides of delightful streams. Arrived at\\n\\nthe country of the five waters, the puissant Dhananjaya planted a rich\\n\\nencampment in the midst of a land that abounded with corn and kine and\\n\\n\\\"The five brothers, with Draupadi forming the sixth, and a dog forming the seventh, set out on their journey. Indeed, even thus did king Yudhishthira depart, himself the head of a party of seven, from the city named after the elephant. The citizen and the ladies of the royal household followed them for some distance. None of them, however, could venture to address the king for persuading him to give up his intention. The denizens of the city then returned; Kripa and others stood around Yuyutsu as their centre. Ulupi, the daughter of the Naga chief, O thou of Kuntis race, entered the waters of Ganga. The princess Chitrangada set out for the capital of Manipura. The other ladies who were the grandmothers of Parikshit centered around him. Meanwhile the high-souled Pandavas, O thou of Kurus race, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\ndecorated most beautifully and which bore the device of a lion in gold,\\n\\nthe handsome prince Vabhruvahana proceeded against his sire for battle.\\n\\nCoining upon the sacrificial steed which was protected by Partha, the\\n\\nheroic prince caused it to be seized by persons well-versed in\\n\\nhorse-lore. Beholding the steed seized, Dhananjaya became filled with\\n\\njoy. Standing on the Earth, that hero began to resist the advance of his\\n\\nson who was on his car. The king afflicted the hero with repeated showers\\n\\nof shafts endued with whetted points and resembling snakes of virulent\\n\\npoison. The battle that took, place between sire and son was\\n\\nincomparable. It resembled the encounter between the deities and the\\n\\nAsuras of old. Each was gratified with obtaining the other for an\\n\\nantagonist. Then Vabhruvahana, laughing, pierced the diadem-decked\\n\\nArjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.\\n\\nEquipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake\\n\\nfor the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\ncircles of light were seen every day around both the Sun and the Moon.\\n\\nThese circles showed three hues. Their edges seemed to be black and rough\\n\\nand ashy-red in colour. These and many other omens, foreshadowing fear\\n\\nand danger, were seen, O king, and filled the hearts of men with anxiety.\\n\\nA little while after, the Kuru king Yudhishthira heard of the wholesale\\n\\ncarnage of the Vrishnis in consequence of the iron bolt. The son of\\n\\nPandu, hearing that only Vasudeva and Rama had escaped with life,\\n\\nsummoned his brothers and took counsel with them as to what they should\\n\\ndo. Meeting with one another, they became greatly distressed upon hearing\\n\\nthat the Vrishnis had met with destruction through the Brahmanas rod of\\n\\nchastisement. The death of Vasudeva, like the drying up of the ocean,\\n\\nthose heroes could not believe. In fact the destruction of the wielder of\\n\\nSaranga was incredible to them. Informed of the incident about the iron\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\non the eve of his journey. So thick was the crowd of spectators that came\\n\\nto behold the horse and the prince who was to follow it, that in\\n\\nconsequence of the pressure of bodies, it seemed a fire was created. Loud\\n\\nwas the noise that arose from that crowd of men who assembled together\\n\\nfor beholding Dhananjaya the son of Kunti, and it seemed to fill all the\\n\\npoints of the compass and the entire welkin. And they said,--'There goes\\n\\nthe son of Kunti, and there that horse of blazing beauty. Indeed, the\\n\\nmighty-armed hero follows the horse, having armed himself with his\\n\\nexcellent bow.'--Even these were the words which Jishnu of noble\\n\\nintelligence heard. The citizens also blessed him, saying,--'Let\\n\\nblessings he thine! Go thou safely and come back, O Bharata.' Others, O\\n\\nchief of men uttered these words--'So great is the press that we do not\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nLessons of Management from Mahabharata \\u2013 Human values and indian Ethos Skip to content Increase Font Size 1. Learning Outcomes 2. Introduction 3.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nKarna is probably the only character in the epic with all the qualities. But she rejected him and married someone who shared her with his brothers. Also, Draupadi is extremely proud of her beauty and she uses it to create jealously among the cousins time and again. Apart from Duryodhana, many men lusted for her. This provoked the disrobing incident to a grat extent. Inference: Do not ask for things you can\\u2019t handle, lower your standards. Also, dont be besotted by your beauty and looks, for they are likely to go against you. Beware of the company you keep \\u2013 Shakuni Young Duryodhana is not as arrogant. But he is slowly spoiled by Gandhar prince, Shakuni. Shakuni slowly fills Duryodhana\\u2019s heart with bitterness and exploits him. Duryodhana is an unmellowed clay, he is provoked to be raged against Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps.

Here's a summary of the key events:\\n\\n**Background**: The Pandavas, led by Arjuna, are on a journey and encounter the deity of fire, Agni, who is standing before them like a hill. Agni tells the Pandavas that he is the god of fire and that he was gratified by Arjuna's service in the past when he helped him burn the Khandava Forest.\\n\\n**The Burning of the Khandava Forest**: Agni tells Arjuna to cast off his celestial bow, Gandiva, and proceed to the woods. Arjuna does so, and Agni proceeds to burn the Khandava Forest. The forest is filled with various creatures, including animals, birds, and even the Nagas (serpents).\\n\\n**Immediate Consequences**: The burning of the forest has an immediate impact on the creatures living there. The animals and birds are forced to flee, and the Nagas are enveloped in a thick smoke that makes it difficult for them to see or breathe. The Airavatas, a group of Nagas, are particularly affected, and their palaces are obscured by the smoke.\\n\\n**Long-term Consequences**: The burning of the Khandava Forest has significant long-term consequences. The forest is reduced to ashes, and the creatures that lived there are forced to adapt to a new environment. The Nagas, in particular, are affected, and their way of life is disrupted. The burning of the forest also has a profound impact on the ecosystem, leading to changes in the local climate and the distribution of species.\\n\\n**Impact on the Pandavas**: The burning of the Khandava Forest also has a significant impact on the Pandavas. Arjuna, in particular, is affected by the memory of the forest and the creatures that lived there. He is haunted by the thought of the suffering he caused and the lives he destroyed.\\n\\n**Impact on the Deity of Fire**: The burning of the Khandava Forest also has a significant impact on the deity of fire, Agni. He is gratified by Arjuna's service, but he is also reminded of the consequences of his actions. Agni's role in the burning of the forest highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of his character, who is both a powerful deity and a force of destruction.\\n\\nOverall, the burning of the Khandava Forest is a pivotal event in the Mahabharata, highlighting the complex relationships between the natural world, the creatures that inhabit it, and the gods who shape its destiny.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Describe the events leading up to and including the burning of the Khandava Forest.

Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).\\n\\nuniverse. The sound of lamentations uttered by those weeping heroes,\\n\\nfilling the spacious chambers of the palace, escaped therefrom and\\n\\npenetrated the very welkin.\\\"'\\n\\nSECTION XXXIX\\n\\n\\\"Narada said, 'The king has not been burnt to death by an unsanctified\\n\\nfire. I have heard this there. I tell thee, O Bharata, such has not been\\n\\nthe fate of Vichitraviryya. It has been heard by us that when the old\\n\\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\\n\\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\\n\\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nof the happiness they felt, regarded that place as Heaven itself. There\\n\\nwas no grief, no fear, no suspicion, no discontent, no reproach in that\\n\\nregion, as those warriors, O monarch, met with one another on that night.\\n\\nMeeting with their sires and brothers and husbands and sons, the ladies\\n\\ncast off all grief and felt great raptures of delight. Having sported\\n\\nwith one another thus for one night, those heroes and those ladies,\\n\\nembracing one another and taking one another's leave returned to the\\n\\nplaces they had come from. Indeed, that foremost of ascetics dismissed\\n\\nthat concourse of warriors. Within the twinkling of an eye that large\\n\\ncrowd disappeared in the very sight of all those (living) persons. Those\\n\\nhigh-souled persons, plunging into the sacred river Bhagirathi proceeded,\\n\\nwith their cars and standards, to their respective abodes. Some went to\\n\\nthe regions of the gods, some to the region of Brahman, some to the\\n\\nunto me,--'O blessed damsel, O thou of beautiful face, thou wilt become\\n\\nthe mother of Dharma. Those deities whom thou wilt summon will be\\n\\nobedient to thee.' Having said those words, the regenerate one vanished\\n\\naway from my sight. I became filled with wonder. The mantra, however,\\n\\nwhich the Rishi gave has dwelt in my memory at all times. One day,\\n\\nsitting within my chamber I beheld the sun rising. Desiring to bring the\\n\\nmaker of day before me, I recollected the words of the Rishi. Without any\\n\\nconsciousness of the fault I committed, I summoned the deity from mere\\n\\ngirlishness. The deity, however, of a thousand rays, (summoned by me)\\n\\ncame to my presence. He divided himself in twain. With one portion he was\\n\\nin the firmament, and with the other he stood on the Earth before me.\\n\\nWith one he heated the worlds and with another he came to me. He told me,\\n\\nwhile I was trembling at his sight, these words,--'Do thou ask a boon of\\n\\ncreature. Thinking of this I become stupefied. In vain was the deity of\\n\\nfire gratified at Khandava by Arjuna. Ingrate that he is, forgetting that\\n\\nservice he has burnt to death the mother of his benefactor! Alas, how\\n\\ncould that deity burn the mother of Arjuna. Putting on the guise of a\\n\\nBrahmana, he had formerly come to Arjuna for soliciting a favour. Fie on\\n\\nthe deity of fire! Fie on the celebrated success of Partha's shafts! This\\n\\nis another incident, O holy one, that appears to me to be productive of\\n\\ngreater misery, for that lord of Earth met with death by union with a\\n\\nfire that was not sacred. How could such a death overtake that royal sage\\n\\nof Kuru's race who, after having ruled the whole Earth, was engaged in\\n\\nthe practice of penances. In that great forest there were fires that had\\n\\nbeen sanctified with mantras. Alas, my father has made his exit from this\\n\\nworld, coming in contact with an unsanctified fire! I suppose that\\n\\nreply,--'Blessed be thou; all that thou hast said unto me will happen.\\n\\n(As regards the birth of Karna) no fault is ascribable to thee. Thou wert\\n\\nrestored to virginity.

By word, by sight, by touch, and by\\n\\nsexual union, also, they beget children. These are the five methods. Thou\\n\\nbelongest to the order of humanity. Thou hast no fault (in what\\n\\nhappened). Know this. O Kunti. Let the fever of thy heart be dispelled.\\n\\nFor those that are mighty, everything is becoming. 'For those that are\\n\\nmighty, everything is pure. For those that are mighty, everything is\\n\\nmeritorious. For those that are mighty, everything is their own.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION XXXI.\\n\\n\\\"Vyasa said, 'Blessed be thou, O Gandhari, thou shalt behold thy sons and\\n\\nbrothers and friends and kinsmen along with thy sires this night like men\\n\\nornaments, and wearing celestial vestments and garlands, they proceeded\\n\\nto those regions where their husbands had found their abodes. Possessed\\n\\nof excellent behaviour and many virtues, their anxieties all dispelled,\\n\\nthey were seen to ride on excellent cars, and endued with every\\n\\naccomplishment they found those regions of happiness which were theirs by\\n\\nright. Devoted to the duties of piety, Vyasa, at that time, becoming a\\n\\ngiver of boons, granted unto all the men there assembled the fruition of\\n\\nthe wishes they respectively cherished. People of diverse realms, hearing\\n\\nof this meeting between the hallowed dead and living human beings, became\\n\\nhighly delighted. That man who duly listens to this narrative meets with\\n\\neverything that is dear to him. Indeed, he obtains all agreeable objects\\n\\nboth here and hereafter. That man of learning and science, that foremost\\n\\nof righteous persons, who recites this narrative for the hearing of\\n\\nproceeded to a spot on the margin of Ganga. He then bathed in the sacred\\n\\nstream and finishing his ablutions turned his face towards his retreat.\\n\\nThe wind rose high. A fierce forest-conflagration set in. It began to\\n\\nburn that forest all around. When the herds of animals were being burnt\\n\\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\\n\\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\\n\\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\\n\\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\\n\\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all. Thy two mothers also,\\n\\nexceedingly emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the\\n\\nconflagration approach him from all sides, addressed the Suta Sanjaya,\\n\\nthat foremost of skilful charioteers, saying,--'Go, O Sanjaya, to such a\\n\\nplace where the fire may not burn thee. As regards ourselves, we shall\\n\\npleased, at the command of Dhritarashtra. He beheld many sacrificial\\n\\naltars with sacred fires blazing on them and with many ascetics seated on\\n\\nthem, that had performed their oblations and poured libations in honour\\n\\nof the deities. Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the\\n\\nforest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled\\n\\nupwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics\\n\\npossessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many\\n\\nthat belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or\\n\\nresting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also\\n\\nwere there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole\\n\\nforest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and\\n\\nKokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with\\n\\nthe chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas. Some were adorned\\n\\nrace, duly and with a pure heart and body. For that reason I shall\\n\\naccomplish what is for thy good. Do my bidding without delay.' Thus\\n\\naddressed by the deity of fire, Utanka did as he was directed. The deity\\n\\nthen, gratified with him, blazed up for consuming everything. From the\\n\\npores of his body, O Bharata, in consequence of his very nature, a thick\\n\\nsmoke issued threatening terrors to the world of Nagas. With that mighty\\n\\nand wide-spreading smoke, O Bharata, everything became enveloped in\\n\\ngloom, so that nothing, O king, could any longer be seen in the world of\\n\\nthe Nagas. Cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions of the\\n\\nAiravatas, uttered by the Nagas headed by Vasuki, O Janamejaya.
