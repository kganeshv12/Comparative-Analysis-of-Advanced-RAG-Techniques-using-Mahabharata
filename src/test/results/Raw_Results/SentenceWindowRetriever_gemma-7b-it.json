The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights.

His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something. Make powerful Allies \\u2013 Network is Power Kauravas were the greatest\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors.

Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\nintelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded\\n\\nArjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the\\n\\nTrigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in\\n\\nscorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the\\n\\nclatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then\\n\\nSuryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya\\n\\nwith hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who\\n\\nfollowed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction\\n\\nof Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down.

Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,Arjuna, that foremost of men, in the shoulder with a straight shaft.\\n\\nEquipt with feathers, that shaft penetrated Arjuna's body like a snake\\n\\npenetrating on an anthill. Piercing the son of Kunti through, the shaft\\n\\nwent deep into the Earth. Feeling acute pain, the intelligent Dhananjaya\\n\\nrested awhile, supporting himself on his excellent bow. He stood, having\\n\\nrecourse to his celestial energy and seemed to outward appearance like\\n\\none deprived of life. That foremost of men, then regaining consciousness,\\n\\npraised his son highly. Possessed of great splendour, the son of Sakra\\n\\nsaid, 'Excellent, Excellent, O mighty-armed one, O son of Chitrangada! O\\n\\nson, beholding this feat, so worthy of thee, I am highly gratified with\\n\\nthee. I shall now shoot these arrows at thee, O son. Stand for fight\\n\\n(without running away).'

Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"## Time as both Destroyer and Preserver in the Mahabharata:\\n\\nThe epic Mahabharata paints a multifaceted picture of Time (Kala), portraying it as both a destructive and preserving force. This duality is evident in various instances throughout the epic.\\n\\n**Time as the Destroyer:**\\n\\n* **The curse of Time:** The opening passage describes Time as a terrifying, fierce entity that terrorizes the Vrishnis and Andhakas. Despite their valiant attempts, their actions are futile as Time effortlessly pierces their defenses.\\n* **The destruction of the Vrishnis:** Time is directly responsible for the downfall of the Vrishnis, culminating in their annihilation by Krishna.\\n* **The cosmic cycle:** The recurring instances of constellations being struck by planets and the changing fortunes of the Yadavas suggest a cyclical nature of time that brings both destruction and renewal.\\n\\n**Time as the Preserver:**\\n\\n* **Krishna's ascension:** While Time brings destruction to the Vrishnis, it also allows Krishna to ascend to Heaven, suggesting a necessary balance between change and permanence.\\n* **Forecasting and prevention:** Krishna's ability to predict future dangers and take preventive measures (e.g., rescuing the Pandavas from Ashwathama) demonstrates the potential of time for planning and protection.\\n* **The cyclical nature of life:** The recurring patterns of victory and defeat in the Kurukshetra war point towards a cyclical nature of life and death, where destruction is ultimately a precursor to renewal.\\n\\n**Additional Interpretations:**\\n\\n* **The balance of opposites:** The portrayal of Time as both destructive and preserving reflects the inherent duality of life. Change is necessary for growth, but it also brings destruction. This balance is crucial for maintaining equilibrium in the universe.\\n* **The role of agency:** While Time is a powerful force, the actions of individuals also play a role in shaping their destinies. The Pandavas' resilience and Krishna's guidance demonstrate that individuals can navigate through the destructive forces of time.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nThe Mahabharata presents a nuanced and complex view of Time, highlighting its dual nature as both a destructive and preserving force. This understanding of time is relevant to modern life, reminding us that change is constant, but it is also an opportunity for growth and renewal.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Analyze how the concept of Time (Kala) is portrayed as both a destroyer and preserver throughout the epic, using specific examples from different parvas?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"1\\n\\nOm!

Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nAffectionate words used with full respect can do the wonders in effective management. Mahabharata\\u2019s incident highlights the importance of effective communication. When Gandhari wished to curse Judhishthra after the war, Krishna spoke in gentle words with full respect and empathy to Gandhari and give the message to forgive Judhishthra. Gandhari understood Krishna\\u2019s message and did not curse Judhishthra. Thus, effective and empathetic communication saved Judhishthra. 3.6 Forecasting future Mahabharata also give a wonderful management message of forecasting the future and taking preventive actions accordingly. In Mahabharata, when Ashwathama planned to kill all Pandavas, Krishna forecasted the danger in the future with his sharp observation and intellectual power and took all the Pandavas to Hastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru.

Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nLessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\\n\\ncomes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision and I will stick to it no matter what happens. Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness. So context keeps changing and you will have to keep changing your decisions with the context. If you do not change your decision making instinct with the context, prepare for a storm, prepare for the \\u201cMahabharata\\u201d.\"]}": {

His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma.

Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,against Pandavas. Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts.

Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one. No coordination at all, the Kaurava generals fought their individual wars.

Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his\\n\\ngave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a noble spirit which rarely appears in the human race. Despite all this, he is a loyal friend. He knows Duryodhana is wrong but he still takes his side and not his brothers. This is because it is Duryodhana who has given him identity in the society. He promises Kunti that he will not kill any Pandava except Arjuna. Karna knows that kauravas will lose but he fights to repay Duryodhana\\u2019s debt. On many occasions, he was provoked to switch sides. Kunti, Indra, Krishna tried to provoke him but he walked away. He said \\u2013 I cannot leave my friend at a time when he needs me the most. Inference: A friend in need is a friend indeed. In Life, you may not get what you deserve but nevertheless, you got to dedicate your life to something.

Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari, three pivotal female characters, embody different aspects of womanhood and their actions profoundly shape the narrative's trajectory.\\n\\n**Draupadi:**\\n\\n* **Symbol of Strength and Agency:** Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, is a fierce and independent woman. She is not merely a passive recipient of fate but actively participates in shaping events. Her humiliation at the dice game, orchestrated by the Kauravas, ignites the war, demonstrating the devastating consequences of patriarchal oppression. \\n* **Champion of Dharma:** Draupadi's unwavering commitment to dharma (righteousness) is evident throughout the epic. She challenges injustice, defends her honor, and stands by her husbands, even in the face of adversity. Her role as a strategist and advisor to the Pandavas highlights her intelligence and political acumen.\\n* **Embodiment of Feminine Power:** Draupadi's beauty, intelligence, and strength challenge the traditional image of the submissive woman. She is a force to be reckoned with, capable of influencing the course of history.\\n\\n**Kunti:**\\n\\n* **The Wise and Powerful Mother:** Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas, is a figure of immense wisdom and authority. She acts as a guiding force for her sons, offering them counsel and support. Her decision to raise Karna, her son born out of wedlock, demonstrates her compassion and moral strength.\\n* **Embodiment of Maternal Love and Sacrifice:** Kunti's love for her sons knows no bounds. She sacrifices her own happiness for their well-being and endures immense pain throughout the epic. Her role as a mediator and peacemaker underscores her desire for harmony and reconciliation.\\n* **A Model of Dharma:** Kunti's unwavering adherence to dharma, even when faced with difficult choices, makes her a role model for all. She teaches her sons the importance of righteousness, compassion, and selflessness.\\n\\n**Gandhari:**\\n\\n* **The Devoted Wife and Mother:** Gandhari, the wife of Dhritarashtra, is a woman of unwavering loyalty and devotion. She endures the pain of her husband's blindness and the suffering of her sons, remaining steadfast in her commitment to her family.\\n* **A Voice of Reason and Restraint:** Despite her deep love for her sons, Gandhari recognizes the Kauravas' flaws and attempts to guide them towards righteousness. Her pleas for peace and reconciliation are often ignored, highlighting the tragic consequences of blind ambition and hatred.\\n* **A Symbol of Sacrifice and Endurance:** Gandhari's life is marked by sacrifice and endurance. She blinds herself to share in her husband's blindness, demonstrating the depth of her love and commitment.\\n\\n**The Mahabharata's View on Gender, Power, and Dharma:**\\n\\nThrough these complex female characters, the Mahabharata explores the interplay of gender, power, and dharma. It challenges the patriarchal norms of its time by showcasing women who are not merely passive figures but active agents in shaping their destinies and influencing the course of events.\\n\\n* **Dharma transcends gender:** The epic emphasizes that dharma is not confined to any particular gender. Both men and women are expected to uphold righteousness, and the consequences of violating dharma are equally severe for both.\\n* **Power can be wielded in diverse ways:** The Mahabharata demonstrates that power can be wielded not only through physical strength and political influence but also through wisdom, compassion, and moral authority.\\n* **Women's voices matter:** The epic gives voice to women's experiences and perspectives, highlighting their intelligence, strength, and agency.\\n\\n\\nThe Mahabharata's portrayal of Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari remains relevant today, offering valuable insights into the complexities of gender roles, the importance of dharma, and the enduring power of female characters in shaping history.\\n\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Examine the role of women in the Mahabharata, focusing on Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari.

This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\\n\\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\\n\\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\\n\\njust never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of\\n\\nAmvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great\\n\\nenergy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and\\n\\njuice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as\\n\\nbefore.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse\\n\\nkinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of\\n\\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\\n\\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava force\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physicaland every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\nHastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nversed in dialectical disputations. When the time came for erecting the\\n\\nsacrificial stake, O chief of Bharata's race, six stakes were set up that\\n\\nwere made of Vilwa,[209] six that were made of Khadira, and six that were\\n\\nmade of Saravarnin. Two stakes were get up by the priests that were made\\n\\nof Devadaru in that sacrifice of the Kuru king, and one that was made of\\n\\nSleshmataka. At the command of the king, Bhima caused some other stakes\\n\\nto be set up, for the sake of beauty only, that were made of gold.\\n\\nAdorned with fine cloths supplied by the royal sage, those stakes shone\\n\\nthere like Indra and the deities with the seven celestial Rishis standing\\n\\naround them in Heaven. A number of golden bricks were made for\\n\\nconstructing therewith a Chayana. The Chayana made resembled in beauty\\n\\nthat which had been made for Daksha, the lord of creatures (on the\\n\\noccasion of his great sacrifice). The Chayana measured eight and ten\\n\\nfor the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic Management Strategic management is prerequisite for success of any corporate. Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\"]}": {

Their prowess is acknowledged even by their adversaries.\\n* **Loyalty:** Both are fiercely loyal to their respective sides. Karna remains steadfast to Duryodhana despite knowing the Kauravas' inherent flaws, while Arjuna is devoted to the Pandavas and their cause.\\n* **Tragic Fates:** Both experience profound tragedy. Karna, despite his abilities, is denied his rightful place and ultimately meets a tragic end. Arjuna, though victorious, grapples with the consequences of war and the loss of loved ones.\\n* **Divine Connections:** Both have divine connections. Arjuna receives guidance and support from Krishna, while Karna is blessed by Surya, the Sun God. These connections highlight the role of fate and divine intervention in shaping their destinies.\\n\\n**Differences:**\\n\\n* **Upbringing and Social Standing:** Arjuna is born into the royal family of Pandu, enjoying a privileged upbringing and recognition. Karna, despite being Kunti's eldest son, is abandoned and raised as a charioteer's son, facing societal prejudice and a constant struggle for acceptance.\\n* **Moral Compass:** While both are skilled warriors, Arjuna's moral compass is generally aligned with righteousness. He wrestles with the ethical dilemmas of war but ultimately fights for what he believes is right. Karna, though capable of great compassion, is often swayed by loyalty to Duryodhana, leading him to make questionable choices.\\n* **Choices and Actions:** Arjuna, despite his doubts, ultimately chooses to fight for dharma and the Pandavas. Karna, bound by his oath to Duryodhana, chooses a path that leads to his downfall.\\n\\n**Contribution to Themes:**\\n\\nThe parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna contribute significantly to the Mahabharata's exploration of:\\n\\n* **Dharma and Adharma:** Their contrasting choices highlight the complexities of dharma (righteousness) and adharma (unrighteousness). Arjuna's struggle to reconcile his duty with his personal feelings reflects the internal conflict inherent in upholding dharma. Karna's unwavering loyalty to Duryodhana, despite knowing his flaws, raises questions about the nature of loyalty and its potential to overshadow righteousness.\\n* **Fate and Free Will:** Both characters are influenced by divine forces and their own choices. Arjuna's divine guidance and Karna's celestial blessings underscore the role of fate, while their individual decisions ultimately shape their destinies.\\n* **The Human Condition:** Their stories explore the universal themes of ambition, loyalty, love, loss, and the consequences of choices. Both characters are flawed and complex, reminding us that even heroes are capable of making mistakes and facing tragic outcomes.\\n\\n\\nThe contrasting paths of Karna and Arjuna serve as a powerful reminder that even within a single epic, there are multiple perspectives on righteousness, duty, and the human condition. Their stories continue to resonate with readers centuries later, prompting reflection on the choices we make and the consequences that follow.\\n\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Compare and contrast the characters of Karna and Arjuna, analyzing their similarities, differences, and how their parallel journeys contribute to the epic's themes.\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"against Pandavas.

The epic emphasizes how Time relentlessly erodes even the most powerful lineages, reminding us of the impermanence of all things.\\n\\n**Time as Preserver:**\\n\\n* **The Cycle of Birth and Death:** The Mahabharata constantly reiterates the cyclical nature of Time, emphasizing the continuous flow of birth, death, and rebirth.

The mighty bowmen among the Vrishnis shot hundreds and thousands\\n\\nof shafts at him, but none of these succeeded in piercing him, for he was\\n\\nnone else than the Destroyer of all creatures.

At Prabhasa, through iron\\n\\nbolts generated by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has\\n\\ntaken place of the Vrishni heroes. Awful hath that carnage been, and not\\n\\neven a single hero has escaped. The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and\\n\\nthe Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all endued with high souls, great\\n\\nmight, and leonine pride, have slaughtered one another in battle.\\n\\nPossessed of arms that looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing\\n\\nthe strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with\\n\\nblades of Eraka grass.

Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nduring the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy, excellence, economy as well as ecology along with preservation of ethics. This will lead to progress, success, welfare and hence sustainable and inclusive growth. However, any deed opposing values and performed under wickedness will lead to ego and greediness. This will further lead to anger and estrangement and hence cause destruction. Thus a good manager should learn lessons from one of the ancient epic Mahabharata. Efficient and effective management can be implemented with concentrating on values which will bring forth successful business ventures. The great epic Mahabharata teaches very effective principles of Management. If any situation will be managed with full commitment, loyalty, dedication with proper strategic planning then it will lead to efficiency and effectiveness. Empathy\\n\\nforts, and the forces, O foremost one of Kuru's race, may or may not be\\n\\ntampered with. (Thou shouldst, therefore, behave in such a manner that\\n\\nthese may not be tampered with by thy foes). The twelve (enumerated\\n\\nabove), O son of Kunti, constitute the principal concerns of kings. These\\n\\ntwelve, as also sixty, having Ministers for their foremost, should be\\n\\nlooked after by the king.[14] Professors conversant with the science of\\n\\npolitics call these by the name of Mandala. Understand, O Yudhishthira,\\n\\nthat the six incidents (of peace, war, march, halt, sowing dissensions,\\n\\nand conciliation) depend upon these. Growth and diminution should also be\\n\\nunderstood, as also the condition of being stationary. The attributes of\\n\\nthe sixfold incidents, O thou of mighty arms, as resting on the two and\\n\\nseventy (already enumerated), should also be carefully understood.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"Bhishma's vow of celibacy, known as Akhanda Pratigya, is a powerful example of duty triumphing over personal desire in the Mahabharata. \\n\\nHere's how it reflects this central theme:\\n\\n* **Unwavering Duty:** Bhishma's decision to renounce marriage and fatherhood was driven by his absolute loyalty and devotion to his father, Shantanu. He prioritized his father's happiness and desire to remarry above his own personal aspirations. This demonstrates the paramount importance of duty, particularly filial duty, in the Mahabharata's ethical framework.\\n\\n* **Self-Sacrifice:** Bhishma's vow involved a profound self-sacrifice. He willingly gave up the opportunity to experience the joys of family and procreation for the sake of his father. This act of selflessness highlights the Mahabharata's emphasis on putting the needs of others, especially those in authority, above one's own.\\n\\n* **Unforeseen Consequences:**  While Bhishma's vow initially served his father's happiness, it ultimately led to unforeseen and tragic consequences. The birth of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, who were both flawed and contributed to the Kurukshetra War, demonstrates how even well-intentioned actions driven by duty can have unintended and devastating outcomes.\\n\\n* **The Dilemma of Duty:** Bhishma's story presents a complex dilemma: the conflict between fulfilling one's duty and the potential for personal happiness and fulfillment. It raises questions about the limits of duty and the potential for unintended harm when personal desires are suppressed.\\n\\n* **Moral Ambiguity:**  Bhishma's unwavering adherence to his vow, even when it led to negative consequences, makes him a morally ambiguous character. While his devotion to duty is admirable, his inflexibility and inability to adapt to changing circumstances ultimately contribute to the tragedy of the Mahabharata.\\n\\n\\nIn conclusion, Bhishma's vow of celibacy serves as a powerful illustration of the Mahabharata's exploration of duty versus personal desire. It highlights the complexities of ethical decision-making, the potential for unintended consequences, and the moral ambiguities that arise when duty clashes with personal happiness. \\n\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"Lessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life.

Having obtained\\r\\nthat worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats\\r\\n(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock\\r\\nfeathers.
