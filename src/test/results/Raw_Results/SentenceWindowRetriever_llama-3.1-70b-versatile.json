        "{\"actual_output\": \"Karna and Arjuna are two pivotal characters in the epic, whose complex and multifaceted personalities serve as a microcosm for the larger themes of the story. On one hand, they share a deep sense of honor, loyalty, and duty, which drives their actions throughout the narrative. Both characters are also depicted as skilled warriors, with a strong sense of pride and a desire to prove themselves in battle.\\n\\nHowever, their similarities belie significant differences in their backgrounds, motivations, and values. Karna, the illegitimate son of a king, is driven by a desire for recognition and acceptance, which often leads him to make choices that compromise his integrity. In contrast, Arjuna, the legitimate son of a king, is guided by a strong sense of justice and a commitment to doing what is right, even if it means sacrificing his own interests.\\n\\nTheir parallel journeys serve to highlight the consequences of their choices and the nature of their characters. While Karna's actions are often motivated by a desire for validation and acceptance, Arjuna's actions are driven by a sense of duty and a commitment to his values. This contrast serves to underscore the themes of the epic, particularly the importance of integrity, honor, and loyalty in the face of adversity.\\n\\nFurthermore, the epic uses the characters of Karna and Arjuna to explore the complexities of identity, particularly in the context of social class and status. Karna's illegitimacy serves as a metaphor for the marginalized and the oppressed, while Arjuna's privileged position highlights the privileges and responsibilities that come with power and status. Through their parallel journeys, the epic raises important questions about the nature of identity, class, and social status, and the ways in which these factors shape our experiences and choices.\\n\\nUltimately, the characters of Karna and Arjuna serve as a powerful reminder of the complexities and nuances of human nature, and the ways in which our choices and actions reflect our values and motivations.

And the multiform Dhananjaya filled with\\r\\nwrath, prevented the disappearance of his foe by means of his weapon\\r\\nknown by the name of Sabda-veda. \\n\\nAs soon as those weapons, issued from Drona's bow, Dhananjaya destroyed\\r\\nthem quickly.  When his weapons were thus duly destroyed by Arjuna with\\r\\nhis own weapons, Drona shrouded the son of Pandu with the mightiest of\\r\\ncelestial weapons.  Every weapon, however, that Drona shot at Partha from\\r\\ndesire of vanquishing the latter, was shot by Partha in return for\\r\\nbaffling it.  Seeing all his weapons, even the celestial ones, duly\\r\\nbaffled by Arjuna, Drona applauded the latter in his heart.

On one hand, it is portrayed as a destroyer, responsible for the creation and destruction of all things. This is evident in the passage where it is stated that \\\"all acts in this world and all abstentions, as also all their modifications, are said to be influenced by Kala.\\\" This suggests that Time is the driving force behind the constant flux and change in the universe.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Time is also depicted as a preserver, maintaining the balance and order of the universe. The passage mentions that \\\"all creatures, mobile and immobile, in heaven, or earth, are influenced by Kala,\\\" implying that Time governs the natural order of things. This is further reinforced by the fact that the epic describes Time as imbuing the whole universe with its influence, suggesting a sense of unity and interconnectedness.\\n\\nIn the context of the epic's portrayal of Time, the concept of the cycles of creation and destruction is particularly relevant. The passage mentions the \\\"great cycles\\\" and the \\\"Yugas\\\" that follow one another in succession, implying a cyclical view of time. This suggests that Time is not just a linear progression, but rather a recurring pattern of creation and destruction.\\n\\nFurthermore, the epic's depiction of Time as a force that governs the natural world is also evident in the passage where it is stated that \\\"the deity of a hundred sacrificer, Fire, Sky, Earth, Mitra and Parjanya, Aditi, and the Vasus, Rivers and Oceans, all existent and non-existent objects, are created and destroyed by Kala.\\\" This suggests that Time is the underlying force that governs the natural world, shaping the very fabric of reality.\\n\\nIn terms of specific examples from different parvas, the concept of Time is explored in various ways. For instance, in the passage from the 13th parva, Time is depicted as a force that governs the lives of individuals, influencing their actions and decisions. The passage mentions that \\\"all acts in this world and all abstentions, as also all their modifications, are said to be influenced by Kala,\\\" suggesting that Time is the driving force behind human behavior.\\n\\nIn contrast, the passage from the 13th parva also highlights the preservative aspect of Time, where the princess blesses the protagonist with her words, asking various deities and natural phenomena to protect him on his journey. This suggests that Time is not just a destroyer, but also a preserver that maintains the balance and order of the universe.\\n\\nOverall, the concept of Time in the epic is complex and multifaceted, portraying it as both a destroyer and a preserver.

Her actions and choices, such as her unwavering loyalty to her husbands and her unrelenting pursuit of justice, drive the narrative forward and highlight the epic's views on female agency and empowerment. Her character also underscores the societal expectations placed on women, as she is often expected to conform to traditional feminine norms while also navigating the challenges of her unique situation.\\n\\nKunti, as the mother of the Pandavas, embodies the role of a matriarch and a symbol of maternal love and sacrifice. Her actions and choices, such as her decision to reveal the truth about her son Karna's parentage, demonstrate the epic's views on the complexities of motherhood and the moral dilemmas that women face. Her character also highlights the societal expectations placed on women as caregivers and nurturers.\\n\\nGandhari, as the wife of Dhritarashtra and the queen of Hastinapura, represents the role of a woman in a position of power and authority.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"Karna and Arjuna, two prominent characters in the epic, exhibit both striking similarities and differences. One of the most notable similarities between the two is their exceptional prowess in arms. Both Karna and Arjuna are accomplished warriors, with Karna being described as \\\"accomplished in arms\\\" and Arjuna being recognized for his \\\"proficiency in arms.\\\" This similarity highlights their parallel journeys as warriors, each striving to prove themselves as the greatest.\\n\\nHowever, their differences are equally significant. Karna, despite being a skilled warrior, is often driven by a desire for validation and recognition. His actions are motivated by a need to prove himself, particularly in the eyes of Duryodhana, who has taken him under his wing. In contrast, Arjuna's actions are guided by a sense of duty and loyalty to his family and kingdom. This difference in motivation highlights their distinct personalities and values.\\n\\nAnother notable difference between the two characters is their social status. Karna, despite being the son of a god, is raised as a charioteer's son and faces social stigma due to his uncertain parentage. Arjuna, on the other hand, is a prince and a member of the royal family. This difference in social status contributes to their distinct experiences and worldviews.\\n\\nDespite these differences, their parallel journeys contribute significantly to the epic's themes. The rivalry between Karna and Arjuna serves as a backdrop to explore the complexities of identity, loyalty, and duty. Their contrasting experiences and motivations highlight the challenges of navigating social hierarchies and the consequences of one's actions.\\n\\nFurthermore, their parallel journeys also underscore the theme of fate versus free will. Karna's circumstances are shaped by his uncertain parentage and social status, while Arjuna's path is influenced by his royal upbringing and sense of duty. This contrast raises questions about the extent to which individuals can shape their own destinies and the role of fate in determining their outcomes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the characters of Karna and Arjuna exhibit both striking similarities and differences, which contribute to the epic's exploration of themes such as identity, loyalty, duty, and fate.
