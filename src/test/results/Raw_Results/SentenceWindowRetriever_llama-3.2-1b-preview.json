This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\\n\\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\\n\\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\\n\\njust never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of\\n\\nAmvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great\\n\\nenergy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and\\n\\njuice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as\\n\\nbefore.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse\\n\\nkinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of\\n\\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\\n\\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\\n\\ngreat happiness in that forest. Towards the close of that period, O\\n\\nsinless one, Vyasa came there. While all those princes sat around Vyasa,\\n\\nengaged in conversation on diverse subjects, other Rishis came to that\\n\\nspot. They were Narada, and Parvata and Devala of austere penances, and\\n\\nViswavasu and Tumvuru, and Chitrasena., O Bharata. Endued with severe\\n\\npenances, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, with the permission of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, worshipped them according to due rites. Having obtained\\n\\nthat worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats\\n\\n(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock\\n\\nfeathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\\n\\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava forceOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war.

All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nnew ideas, innovative practices. This will help the team members to take responsibilities and grow higher. In addition organizations will earn more profits and achieve their goals in lesser time. In Mahabharata, Kauravas had centralized leadership there was only one head at a time of eleven divisions. Organizational Structure of Kaurvas On the other hand, Pandavas have opted decentralized system. Lord Krishna was the supreme guide. Arjuna was the supreme commander. Dhrshtadymna was commander in chief of seven commanders. The Pandavas made seven commanders for the seven divisions. The army of Pandavas was decentralized in to seven divisions called as Akshauhini. Besides, Yudhishtra, Bhima, Nakul, Sahadeva, Kunti and Draupadi also participated in management. Organizational Structure of Pandavas Other Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\"]}": {

I think that what has happened is due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all). It behoveth thee also to see it.\\n\\nseen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse\\n\\nkinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nanyone. Why then, O chief of Bharatas race, this exceedingly dejected\\n\\naspect? It behoveth thee, O son of Pritha, to tell me all, if, indeed,\\n\\nthere be no harm in telling it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Arjuna said, He whose complexion was like that of a (newly-risen) cloud,\\n\\nhe whose eyes were like a pair of large lotus petals, Krishna, has, with\\n\\nRama, cast off his body and ascended to Heaven. At Prabhasa, through iron\\n\\nbolts generated by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has\\n\\ntaken place of the Vrishni heroes. Awful hath that carnage been, and not\\n\\neven a single hero has escaped. The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and\\n\\nthe Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all endued with high souls, great\\n\\nmight, and leonine pride, have slaughtered one another in battle.\\n\\nPossessed of arms that looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing\\n\\nthe strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with\\n\\nblades of Eraka grass. Behold the perverse course of Time. 500,000\\n\\nstupefied, the Saindhava warriors once more shot at that senseless\\n\\nwarrior, without loss of time, innumerable other shafts. Understanding\\n\\nthat the son of Pritha was deprived of consciousness, the deities, with\\n\\nhearts penetrated by fear, began to seek his welfare by uttering diverse\\n\\nbenedictions. Then the celestial Rishis, the seven Rishis, and the\\n\\nregenerate Rishis, became engaged in silent recitations from desire of\\n\\ngiving victory to Pritha's son of great intelligence. When at last the\\n\\nenergy of Partha blazed forth through those acts of the denizens of\\n\\nHeaven, that hero, who was conversant with celestial weapons of high\\n\\nefficacy, stood immovable like a hill. The delighter of the Kurus then\\n\\ndrew his celestial bow. And as he repeatedly stretched the bowstring, the\\n\\ntwang that followed resembled the loud sound of some mighty machine. Like\\n\\nPurandara pouring rain, the puissant Arjuna then, with that bow of his,also, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\\n\\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\\n\\nfor applying each. Calamity, O king, as it overtakes rulers should be\\n\\nregarded as of many forms. Listen, O thou of Kuru's race, as to what\\n\\nthose diverge forms are. Verily of various kinds are calamities, O son of\\n\\nPandu. Thou shouldst always count them, distinguishing their forms, O\\n\\nking, and strive to meet them by applying the well-known ways of\\n\\nconciliation and the rest (without concealing them through idleness). The\\n\\nking should, when equipt with a good force, march (out against a foe), O\\n\\nscorcher of enemies. He should attend also to the considerations of time\\n\\nand place, while preparing to march, as also to the forces he has\\n\\ncollected and his own merits (in other respects). That king who is\\n\\nattentive to his own growth and advancement should not march unless\\n\\nequipt with cheerful and healthy warriors. When strong, O son of Pandu,\\n\\nhe may march in even an unfavourable season. The king should make a river\\n\\nhaving quivers for its stones, steeds and cars for its current, and\\n\\nforts, and the forces, O foremost one of Kuru's race, may or may not be\\n\\ntampered with. (Thou shouldst, therefore, behave in such a manner that\\n\\nthese may not be tampered with by thy foes). The twelve (enumerated\\n\\nabove), O son of Kunti, constitute the principal concerns of kings. These\\n\\ntwelve, as also sixty, having Ministers for their foremost, should be\\n\\nlooked after by the king.[14] Professors conversant with the science of\\n\\npolitics call these by the name of Mandala. Understand, O Yudhishthira,\\n\\nthat the six incidents (of peace, war, march, halt, sowing dissensions,\\n\\nand conciliation) depend upon these. Growth and diminution should also be\\n\\nunderstood, as also the condition of being stationary. The attributes of\\n\\nthe sixfold incidents, O thou of mighty arms, as resting on the two and\\n\\nseventy (already enumerated), should also be carefully understood. When\\n\\none's own side has become strong and the side of the foe his become weak,\"]}": {

This decision was likely motivated by the king's desire to conserve his physical and mental strength, as he had been living in a state of asceticism for some time.\\n\\n2. **The Yajaka Brahmanas' actions**: The Yajaka Brahmanas, who were present in the woods, cast off the king's sacrificial fires in a solitary part of the woods, allowing the fires to grow and eventually produce a general conflagration in the forest.\\n\\n3. **The consequences of the conflagration**: The conflagration in the forest had immediate and long-term consequences. The king, who had been unable to move or exert himself due to his emaciated state, was unable to escape the forest. His two mothers, who were also emaciated, were unable to move either. The king's inability to move or exert himself led to his death, as he was unable to defend himself against the flames.\\n\\n4. **The long-term consequences**: The burning of the Khandava Forest had long-term consequences for the kingdom. The forest was said to be burnt by the deity of fire, which was a powerful and feared entity. The forest was also said to have produced a general conflagration in the forest, which was a sign of the deity's power and displeasure. The burning of the forest also led to the death of the king, which was a significant blow to the kingdom.\\n\\n5. **The emotional and psychological impact**: The burning of the Khandava Forest also had an emotional and psychological impact on the kingdom. The sound of lamentations uttered by the heroes who had been burnt to death filled the spacious chambers of the palace, and the palace was said to have been enveloped in gloom. The king's death was also said to have caused distress to the Nagas, who were said to be headed by Vasuki.\\n\\n6. **The consequences for the Pandavas**: The burning of the Khandava Forest also had consequences for the Pandavas, who were said to have beheld the deity of fire standing before them. The deity of fire was said to have addressed the Pandavas, saying that they were the god of fire, and that the forest of Khandava had been burnt by him. The Pandavas were also said to have been affected by the deity's words, and were said to have become stupefied.\\n\\n7. **The consequences for the kingdom**: The burning of the Khandava Forest also had consequences for the kingdom.

He renounces sex for his father's happiness, which is a selfless act that prioritizes the well-being of others over his own desires. This reflects the theme of duty versus personal desire, where individuals prioritize the greater good over their own personal interests.\\n\\n2. **Selflessness and Sacrifice**: Bhishma's decision to renounce sex is a selfless act that demonstrates his commitment to his father's happiness. He is willing to sacrifice his own desires and well-being for the sake of his family and the kingdom. This selflessness is a hallmark of duty, where individuals prioritize the greater good over their own interests.\\n\\n3. **Personal Desire vs. Duty**: Bhishma's devotion to his father's happiness is also a manifestation of his personal desire. He is deeply devoted to his father and wants to ensure his happiness, even if it means sacrificing his own desires. This personal desire is a fundamental aspect of human nature, where individuals prioritize their own interests over the greater good.\\n\\n4. **Contextual Consideration**: Bhishma's decision is influenced by the context of his situation. He is deeply devoted to his father and wants to ensure his happiness, which is a personal desire. However, his vow of celibacy is also influenced by the context of his situation, where he is expected to marry and produce children to secure the future of the kingdom. This highlights the importance of considering the context in which individuals make decisions, as it can influence their motivations and priorities.\\n\\n5. **Consequences of Personal Desire**: Bhishma's decision ultimately leads to negative consequences, as his vow of celibacy is not fulfilled, and he is unable to marry and produce children. This highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of personal desires, as they can lead to negative outcomes.\\n\\n6. **Influence of External Factors**: Bhishma's decision is also influenced by external factors, such as the influence of his stepmother, Satyavati, and the pressure from his father to marry and produce children. This highlights the importance of considering the influence of external factors on individual decisions, as they can shape the course of events.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata. His selfless act demonstrates his commitment to his father's happiness, while his personal desire is a fundamental aspect of human nature.

Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness.

By choosing to be Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna was fulfilling his role as a divine mentor and guide, which was essential for Arjuna's spiritual growth and development.\\n\\n2. **Crisis Management**: Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer was also a strategic move to manage the crisis situation. By being Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna was able to provide emotional support, guidance, and strategic advice to Arjuna, which helped him to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of the war.\\n\\n3. **Personal Sacrifice**: Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer was also a personal sacrifice. By choosing to be Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna was putting himself in harm's way, as he was exposed to the dangers of the battlefield. This selfless act of sacrifice was a testament to Krishna's devotion to Arjuna and his commitment to helping him achieve his goals.\\n\\n4. **Role Modeling**: Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer also served as a role model for Arjuna. By being a loyal and dedicated charioteer, Krishna set an example for Arjuna to follow, demonstrating the importance of selflessness, loyalty, and devotion in the face of adversity.\\n\\n5. **Avoiding Conflict**: Finally, Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer may have also been a strategic move to avoid conflict. By not fighting in the war himself, Krishna was able to avoid the risks and dangers associated with combat, which would have put him and others at risk. This decision allowed Krishna to focus on his spiritual duties and provide guidance to Arjuna, rather than being drawn into the conflict.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer was a complex and multifaceted one, driven by a combination of spiritual, strategic, personal, role modeling, and avoidance motivations.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Why did Krishna choose to be Arjuna's charioteer rather than fight in the war himself?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"should motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning.

Her actions drive the narrative, showcasing her strength, courage, and determination. As a blind wife, Gandhari is a symbol of feminine strength and resilience, choosing to live her life despite her disability.

Their actions drive the narrative, showcasing their strength, courage, and determination, and reflect the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Mahabharata is a powerful epic that reflects the values of Hinduism, including the importance of feminine power, the balance of masculine and feminine traits, and the role of women in society.

Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nrace, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion of Renunciation, traversed through various countries and reached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind him was Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order of their birth; behind them all, O foremost one of Bharatas race, proceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of dark complexion, and endued with eyes resembling lotus petals.

Costly beds and robes and ornaments, and food and drink\\n\\nand other enjoyable articles, in profusion and of such superior kinds as\\n\\nwere worthy of royal use, were presented by king Yudhishthira unto\\n\\nDhritarashtra. Similarly Kunti behaved towards Gandhari as towards a\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength.

A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault.

This decision is motivated by a sense of loyalty and responsibility towards his father, and Bhishma is willing to make personal sacrifices for the sake of his family.\\n\\nHowever, this decision also has negative consequences, as seen in the story of Amba and Bheesma. Bhishma's vow of celibacy ultimately leads to his own downfall, as he is unable to fulfill his duty as a warrior and protector of his kingdom. This highlights the tension between duty and personal desire, and how sometimes, our personal desires can conflict with our duties and responsibilities.\\n\\nFurthermore, Bhishma's devotion to his father's happiness also reflects the theme of duty versus personal desire in the sense that it highlights the importance of prioritizing one's duties and responsibilities over personal desires. Bhishma's decision to renounce sex and marry for his father's happiness is motivated by a sense of duty and loyalty, rather than personal desire or personal gain.\\n\\nIn contrast, the character of Bhima, who is also a warrior and a member of the Kuru family, is more focused on his personal desires and emotions. His reluctance to fight in the battle of Kurukshetra is motivated by his personal sorrows and grief, rather than a sense of duty or responsibility. This highlights the tension between duty and personal desire, and how sometimes, our personal desires can conflict with our duties and responsibilities.\\n\\nOverall, Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata by highlighting the tension between these two competing values. While Bhishma's decision is motivated by a sense of duty and loyalty, it ultimately leads to negative consequences, highlighting the importance of prioritizing one's duties and responsibilities over personal desires.\\n\\nThe story of Amba and Bheesma also highlights the theme of duty versus personal desire. Amba's determination to kill Bheesma, despite knowing that she cannot hold a bow, demonstrates her strong sense of duty and responsibility towards her goal. Her willingness to take multiple births in order to fulfill her duty also highlights the importance of prioritizing one's duties and responsibilities over personal desires.\\n\\nIn contrast, the character of Drona, who is also a warrior and a member of the Kuru family, is more focused on his personal desires and emotions. His reluctance to fight in the battle of Kurukshetra is motivated by his personal sorrows and grief, rather than a sense of duty or responsibility. This highlights the tension between duty and personal desire, and how sometimes, our personal desires can conflict with our duties and responsibilities.\\n\\nUltimately, the theme of duty versus personal desire is a central theme in the Mahabharata, and is reflected in the characters of Bhishma, Bhima, Amba, and Drona.

However, Pandu's five sons, the Pandavas (Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva), and Dhritarashtra's 100 sons, the Kauravas, were rivals for the throne.\\n\\nThe Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, conspired against the Pandavas and had them exiled to the forest of Khandava for 13 years. During their exile, the Pandavas encountered the sage Narada, who told them that they would be able to return to the kingdom only if they could retrieve the sacred fire from the Khandava Forest.\\n\\nThe Pandavas devised a plan to retrieve the fire. They would send Arjuna, the skilled archer, to the forest to retrieve the fire, while the others would create a diversion to distract the forest's inhabitants. Arjuna was given a magical discus, known as the Sudarshan Chakra, which was said to be able to cut through anything.\\n\\nAs Arjuna entered the forest, he encountered the god of fire, Agni, who was being worshipped by the inhabitants of the forest. Agni told Arjuna that he would not give him the fire unless he could answer a riddle. Arjuna agreed and was given the riddle: \\\"What can be broken, but never held? What can be given, but never sold?\\\"\\n\\nArjuna answered the riddle correctly, and Agni was impressed by his wisdom. Agni told Arjuna that he could take the fire, but warned him that the forest was inhabited by many dangers, including the Naga king, Vasuki, and the Rakshasas.\\n\\nArjuna, with the help of his brothers, successfully retrieved the fire and returned to the kingdom. However, their victory was short-lived, as the Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, conspired against them once again.\\n\\nThe Kauravas, with the help of the treacherous Ashvatthama, killed many of the Pandavas, including Bhima and Arjuna's wife, Draupadi. The remaining Pandavas, Yudhishthira, Bhima, and Arjuna, were left with only a few men to fight against the Kauravas.\\n\\nThe war between the Pandavas and the Kauravas, known as the Kurukshetra War, lasted for 18 days and resulted in the deaths of many warriors on both sides.

When the herds of animals were being burnt\\n\\nall around, as also the snakes that inhabited that region, herds of wild\\n\\nboars began to take themselves to the nearest marshes and waters. When\\n\\nthat forest was thus afflicted on all sides and such distress came upon\\n\\nall the living creatures residing there, the king, who had taken no food,\\n\\nwas incapable of moving or exerting himself at all.

I have heard this there. I tell thee, O Bharata, such has not been\\n\\nthe fate of Vichitraviryya. It has been heard by us that when the old\\n\\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\\n\\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\\n\\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nrace, duly and with a pure heart and body. For that reason I shall\\n\\naccomplish what is for thy good. Do my bidding without delay.' Thus\\n\\naddressed by the deity of fire, Utanka did as he was directed. The deity\\n\\nthen, gratified with him, blazed up for consuming everything. From the\\n\\npores of his body, O Bharata, in consequence of his very nature, a thick\\n\\nsmoke issued threatening terrors to the world of Nagas. With that mighty\\n\\nand wide-spreading smoke, O Bharata, everything became enveloped in\\n\\ngloom, so that nothing, O king, could any longer be seen in the world of\\n\\nthe Nagas. Cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions of the\\n\\nAiravatas, uttered by the Nagas headed by Vasuki, O Janamejaya. Enveloped\\n\\nby that smoke, the palaces could no longer be seen, O Bharata. These\\n\\nresembled woods and hill overwhelmed by a thick forest.

Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).those heroes could not believe. In fact the destruction of the wielder of\\n\\nSaranga was incredible to them. Informed of the incident about the iron\\n\\nbolt, the Pandavas became filled with grief and sorrow. In fact, they sat\\n\\ndown, utterly cheerless and penetrated with blank despair.\\\"\\n\\nJanamejaya said: \\\"Indeed, O holy one, how was it that the Andhakas along\\n\\nwith Vrishnis, and those great car-warriors, the Bhojas, met with\\n\\ndestruction in the very sight of Vasudeva?\\\"\\n\\nVaishampayana continued: \\\"When the thirty-sixth year was reached (after\\n\\nthe great battle) a great calamity overtook the Vrishnis. Impelled by\\n\\nTime, they all met with destruction in consequence of the iron bolt.\\\"\\n\\nJanamejaya said: \\\"Cursed by whom did those heroes, the Vrishnis, the\\n\\nAndhakas, and the Bhojas, met with destruction? O foremost regenerate\\n\\npersons, do thou tell me this in detail.\\n\\nVaishampayana continued: \\\"One day, the Vrishni heroes numbering Sarana\\n\\nVaishampayana said, \\\"King Yudhishthira the just, the son of Pritha, had not stayed there for more than a moment when, O thou of Kurus race, all the gods with Indra at their head came to that spot.

Upon the advent of those deities of resplendent bodies and sanctified and noble deeds, the darkness that had overwhelmed that region immediately disappeared. The torments undergone by beings of sinful deeds were no longer seen. The river Vaitarani, the thorny Salmali, the iron jars, and the boulders of rock, so terrible to behold, also vanished from sight. The diverse repulsive corpses also, which the Kuru king had seen, disappeared at the same time. Then a breeze, delicious and fraught with pleasant perfumes, perfectly pure and delightfully cool, O Bharata, began to blow on that spot in consequence of the presence of the gods. The Maruts, with Indra, the Vasus with the\\n\\nAndhakas, and the Bhojas, met with destruction?

Her role in binding the Pandavas together for 14 years is a powerful symbol of her ability to bring people together and foster unity.\\n3. **Exhibits courage and resilience**: Draupadi's experiences, including her abduction by the Kauravas and subsequent humiliation, demonstrate her remarkable courage and resilience. Her ability to overcome adversity and maintain her dignity in the face of adversity is a powerful inspiration to the characters and the audience.\\n\\nKunti, the mother of the Pandavas, is another significant female character who plays a crucial role in shaping the narrative. Her actions and choices reflect the epic's views on:\\n\\n1. **Matrilineal inheritance**: Kunti's role as the supreme authority and decision-maker highlights the importance of matrilineal inheritance and the significance of women's roles in passing down family traditions and values.\\n2. **Dharma and duty**: Kunti's commitment to upholding dharma and duty is a testament to her strong sense of moral responsibility and her willingness to make difficult choices for the benefit of her family and society.\\n3. **Empowerment and agency**: Kunti's actions demonstrate her agency and empowerment, as she takes charge of her family's well-being and makes decisions that shape their destiny.\\n\\nGandhari, the mother of the Kauravas, serves as a foil to Kunti, highlighting the contrast between the two women's approaches to motherhood and their roles in the epic. Gandhari's actions and choices reflect the epic's views on:\\n\\n1. **Patriarchal norms**: Gandhari's adherence to patriarchal norms and her failure to challenge the status quo demonstrate the limitations and constraints placed on women in a patriarchal society.\\n2. **Lack of agency**: Gandhari's inability to assert her own agency and make decisions for her family highlights the lack of empowerment and autonomy available to women in a patriarchal society.\\n3. **Consequences of patriarchal norms**: Gandhari's actions and choices ultimately lead to the downfall of the Kaurava camp, serving as a cautionary tale about the consequences of adhering to patriarchal norms and neglecting the importance of women's roles in society.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Mahabharata presents a nuanced and complex portrayal of women's roles, highlighting their agency, power, and influence on the narrative.

I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant.

Lord Shiva told her what she is asking for is an impossibility, because all these qualities cannot co-exist in one man. Shiva warns her time and again but Draupadi acts like the stubborn Duryodhana, and says that it is up to lord Shiva to grant her the wish she had demanded. So here we see greed and desire crossing all limits. Shiva granted her the wish but warned her of the consequences that are bound to follow.

Time is depicted as a force that governs the universe, influencing the lives of individuals and societies. It is often personified as a powerful entity that can be both benevolent and malevolent.\\n\\nOn one hand, Time is portrayed as a destroyer, responsible for the downfall of empires and the demise of heroes. The Kaurava king, Duryodhana, acknowledges this aspect of Time when he says, \\\"It is Time that cooks every creature (in his cauldron)\\\" (Chapter 1, Section 22). This quote highlights Time's role in bringing about destruction and chaos. The great slaughter of the Vrishnis, as described by Vaishampayana, is a prime example of Time's destructive power. The heroes of the Vrishni and Andhaka races are killed in battle, and even the great Krishna is said to have ascended to Heaven, leaving behind a devastated world.\\n\\nOn the other hand, Time is also portrayed as a preserver, responsible for the cyclical nature of life and the universe. The epic emphasizes the idea that Time is a force that governs the cycles of birth, growth, decay, and rebirth. This is reflected in the concept of the \\\"yugas,\\\" or ages, which are described in the epic as periods of time that repeat themselves in a cycle. The current age, the Kali Yuga, is said to be a time of decline and darkness, but it is also a time of great spiritual and cultural transformation.\\n\\nThe character of Krishna, who is said to have ascended to Heaven, is a prime example of Time's preservative power. Krishna's departure from the world marks the end of an era, but it also paves the way for a new era of spiritual and cultural growth. The epic suggests that Time is a force that allows for the cyclical renewal of life and the universe.\\n\\nFurthermore, the epic highlights the idea that Time is a force that is beyond human control. The Kaurava king's attempt to defy Time by leaving the world is ultimately unsuccessful, as he is forced to confront the reality of his own mortality. This theme is reinforced by the character of Arjuna, who is said to have been deprived of consciousness by the energy of Partha (Krishna). This episode highlights the idea that Time is a force that can be both creative and destructive, and that it is ultimately beyond human control.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of Time (Kala) in the epic Mahabharata is portrayed as both a destroyer and preserver. Time is depicted as a force that governs the universe, influencing the lives of individuals and societies. While it is responsible for the downfall of empires and the demise of heroes, it is also a force that governs the cycles of birth, growth, decay, and rebirth.

When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nanyone. Why then, O chief of Bharatas race, this exceedingly dejected\\n\\naspect? It behoveth thee, O son of Pritha, to tell me all, if, indeed,\\n\\nthere be no harm in telling it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Arjuna said, He whose complexion was like that of a (newly-risen) cloud,\\n\\nhe whose eyes were like a pair of large lotus petals, Krishna, has, with\\n\\nRama, cast off his body and ascended to Heaven. At Prabhasa, through iron\\n\\nbolts generated by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has\\n\\ntaken place of the Vrishni heroes. Awful hath that carnage been, and not\\n\\neven a single hero has escaped. The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and\\n\\nthe Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all endued with high souls, great\\n\\nmight, and leonine pride, have slaughtered one another in battle.\\n\\nPossessed of arms that looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing\\n\\nthe strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with\\n\\nblades of Eraka grass. Behold the perverse course of Time. 500,000\\n\\nstupefied, the Saindhava warriors once more shot at that senseless\\n\\nwarrior, without loss of time, innumerable other shafts. Understanding\\n\\nthat the son of Pritha was deprived of consciousness, the deities, with\\n\\nhearts penetrated by fear, began to seek his welfare by uttering diverse\\n\\nbenedictions. Then the celestial Rishis, the seven Rishis, and the\\n\\nregenerate Rishis, became engaged in silent recitations from desire of\\n\\ngiving victory to Pritha's son of great intelligence. When at last the\\n\\nenergy of Partha blazed forth through those acts of the denizens of\\n\\nHeaven, that hero, who was conversant with celestial weapons of high\\n\\nefficacy, stood immovable like a hill. The delighter of the Kurus then\\n\\ndrew his celestial bow. And as he repeatedly stretched the bowstring, the\\n\\ntwang that followed resembled the loud sound of some mighty machine. Like\\n\\nPurandara pouring rain, the puissant Arjuna then, with that bow of his,Vaishampayana said, \\\"Hear, O king, what the procedure is, and what the fruits, O Bharata, are that will spring from ones listening (to a recitation of the Bharata). Even this, O king of kings, is what thou askest me. The deities of Heaven, O ruler of Earth, came to this world for sport. Having achieved their task, they ascended once more to Heaven. Listen to what I shall tell thee in brief. In the Mahabharata is to be found the births of Rishis and deities on the Earth. In this treatise, called Bharata, O foremost one of Bharatas race, are to be seen in one place the eternal Rudras, the Saddhyas, and the Viswedevas; the Adityas, the two deities named the Ashvinis, the regents of the World, the great Rishis, the Guhyakas, the Gandharvas, the Nagas, the Vidyadharas, the Siddhas, the diverse deities, the Self-born visible in a body, with many ascetics; the Hills and Mountains, Oceans and Seas and Rivers, the diverse tribes of Apsaras; the Planets, the Years, the Half-years, and the\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\nRejoicing greatly, Krishna made gifts unto the child of many valuable\\n\\ngems. The other chiefs of the Vrishni race, did the same. Then the\\n\\npuissant Janarddana, firmly adhering to truth, bestowed a name on the\\n\\ninfant who was thy sire, O monarch.--'Since this child of Abhimanyu has\\n\\nbeen born at a time when this race has become nearly extinct, let his\\n\\nname be Parikshit!' Even this is what he said. Then thy father, O king,\\n\\nbegan to grow, and gladden all the people, O Bharata. When thy father was\\n\\na month old, O hero, the Pandavas came back to their capital, bringing\\n\\nwith them a profusion of wealth. Hearing that the Pandavas were near,\\n\\nthose foremost ones of the Vrishni race went out. The citizens decked the\\n\\ncity called after the elephant with garlands of flowers in profusions,\\n\\nwith beautiful pennons and standards of diverse kinds. The citizens also,\\n\\nO king, adorned their respective mansions. Desirous of doing what was\\n\\n1\\n\\nOm! Having bowed down unto Narayana, and to Nara, the foremost of men, as also to the goddess Sarasvati, should the word \\\"Jaya\\\" be uttered.\\n\\nJanamejaya said: \\\"Having heard of that encounter with iron bolts between the heroes of the Vrishni and the Andhaka races, and having been informed also of Krishnas ascension to Heaven, what did the Pandavas do?\\\"\\n\\nVaishampayana said: \\\"Having heard the particulars of the great slaughter of the Vrishnis, the Kaurava king set his heart on leaving the world.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization.

INTRODUCTION: Mahabharata is a story of great historical leaders in India. The basic theme of Mahabharata is \\u2018Dharamayudha\\u2019 that is justice for righteous. Mahabharata is story of battle between Pandavas and Kauravas for throne of Hastinapur. The battle was fought in Kurukshetra and Pandavas were victorious in the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nand Vijaya. Chedi through marriage of Nakula and Karenmayi. Kasi through marriage of Bhima and Balandhara. Kekaya through marriage of Yudhisthira and Devika. Matsya through marriage of Abhimanyu and Uttara. The Rakshasas through marriage of Bhima and Hidimba. The Nagas through marriage of Arjuna and Uloopi. The kingdom of Virat \\u2013 Arjuna saved Virat from Kauravas while disguised as Brihannala This is synonymous to merger and acquisition. Inference: Network with people and expand your reach. Connect with people who will fight with you because you share a similar cause. Teamwork succeeds where Individual effort fails Kauravas lacked team spirit from day one.

Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\"]}": {

This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\\n\\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\\n\\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\\n\\njust never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of\\n\\nAmvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great\\n\\nenergy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and\\n\\njuice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as\\n\\nbefore.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse\\n\\nkinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of\\n\\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\\n\\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\\n\\ngreat happiness in that forest. Towards the close of that period, O\\n\\nsinless one, Vyasa came there. While all those princes sat around Vyasa,\\n\\nengaged in conversation on diverse subjects, other Rishis came to that\\n\\nspot. They were Narada, and Parvata and Devala of austere penances, and\\n\\nViswavasu and Tumvuru, and Chitrasena., O Bharata. Endued with severe\\n\\npenances, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, with the permission of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, worshipped them according to due rites. Having obtained\\n\\nthat worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats\\n\\n(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock\\n\\nfeathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\\n\\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava forceversed in dialectical disputations. When the time came for erecting the\\n\\nsacrificial stake, O chief of Bharata's race, six stakes were set up that\\n\\nwere made of Vilwa,[209] six that were made of Khadira, and six that were\\n\\nmade of Saravarnin. Two stakes were get up by the priests that were made\\n\\nof Devadaru in that sacrifice of the Kuru king, and one that was made of\\n\\nSleshmataka. At the command of the king, Bhima caused some other stakes\\n\\nto be set up, for the sake of beauty only, that were made of gold.\\n\\nAdorned with fine cloths supplied by the royal sage, those stakes shone\\n\\nthere like Indra and the deities with the seven celestial Rishis standing\\n\\naround them in Heaven. A number of golden bricks were made for\\n\\nconstructing therewith a Chayana. The Chayana made resembled in beauty\\n\\nthat which had been made for Daksha, the lord of creatures (on the\\n\\noccasion of his great sacrifice). The Chayana measured eight and ten\\n\\nand slaves both male and female, and goats and sheep, and blankets and\\n\\ncostly articles to be collected, and villages and fields, and other kines\\n\\nof wealth to be kept ready, as also elephants and steeds decked with\\n\\nornaments, and many beautiful maidens who were the best of their sex,\\n\\nthat foremost of kings gave them away for the advancement of the dead,\\n\\nnaming each of them in due order as the gifts were made. Naming Drona,\\n\\nand Bhishma, and Somadatta, and Valhika, and king Duryodhana, and each\\n\\none of his other sons, and all his well-wishers with Jayadratha numbering\\n\\nfirst, those gifts were made in due order. With the approval of\\n\\nYudhishthira, that Sraddha-sacrifice became characterised by large gifts\\n\\nof wealth and profuse presents of jewels and gems and other kinds of\\n\\ntreasure. Tellers and scribes on that occasion, under the orders of\\n\\nYudhishthira, ceaselessly asked the old king.--Do thou command, O\\n\\nmonarch, what gifts should be made to these. All things are ready\\n\\nand his life. Had he given those 5 villages to Pandavas, he would have avoided all this but no, he chosed to be stubborn. Inference: You cannot have everything. Learn how to curb stubbornness or else you risk everything. Organization is bigger than the Individual : Yudhistira Yudhistira is a noble king, an epitome of wisdom and righteousness. Yet he decides to gamble away his entire kingdom not just once but twice. Draupadi asks who gave him to right to lose her, his brothers and the Kingdom? Just because he is the king does not entitle him to gamble away his kingdom. Yudhistira loses his self control and gambles away everything, thinking that the kingdom, the property, his brothers and his wife are all his \\u201cpossessions\\u201d. Inference: The organization (Kingdom) is bigger than the individual (King). The individual has no right to destroy the organization, even if he has founded it. He maybe the manager or owner but the organization is certainly greater than him. Lower your standards, do\\n\\nand every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\"]}": {

When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\nintelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded\\n\\nArjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the\\n\\nTrigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in\\n\\nscorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the\\n\\nclatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then\\n\\nSuryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya\\n\\nwith hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who\\n\\nfollowed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction\\n\\nof Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\\n\\noff those arrows of sharp and terrible points, resembling snakes of\\n\\nvirulent poison, before they could come up to him. Having cut off those\\n\\nsharp arrows equipt with Kanka feathers, Arjuna pierced each of the\\n\\nwarriors opposed to him with a whetted shaft. The Saindhava Kshatriyas,\\n\\nrecollecting that it was Dhananjaya who had slain their king Jayadratha,\\n\\nthen hurled at him darts and javelins with great force. The diadem-decked\\n\\nDhananjaya of great might baffled their intent by cutting off all those\\n\\nweapons before any of them could reach him. At length the son of Pandu\\n\\nbecame highly angry. With many straight and broad-headed arrows, he\\n\\nfelled the heads of many of those warriors who were rushing at him from\\n\\ndesire of victory. Many fled, many rushed at Arjuna; many moved not, all\\n\\nof them, however, uttered such aloud noise (of wrath and grief) that it\\n\\nresembled the roar of the ocean.

This concept is woven throughout the epic, and I will provide specific examples from different parvas to illustrate this.\\n\\nAs a destroyer:\\n\\n1. In the Udyoga Parva, Janamejaya inquires about the Vrishni race's destruction, which was a result of Time's course. Time is depicted as an irresistible force that leads to the annihilation of even powerful dynasties like the Vrishnis.\\n\\n2. In the Stri Parva, when Yudhishthira hears about the Vrishni carnage, he attributes it to the influence of destiny and Time. Time is portrayed as an unavoidable force that brings about the end of great heroes and kings.\\n\\n3. In the Sauptika Parva, the celestial Rishis, the seven Rishis, and the regenerate Rishis engage in silent recitations to give victory to Partha, but it is only when the energy of Partha blazes forth that he stands immovable like a hill. Time is depicted as an unyielding force that even the gods cannot easily overcome.\\n\\nAs a preserver:\\n\\n1. In the Adi Parva, Sage Vyasa explains that Time is the foundation of the universe, and it preserves the order of creation. Time is the basis for the cycles of day and night, seasons, and the progression of life and death, ensuring the continuity of the universe.\\n\\n2. In the Bhishma Parva, when Bhishma lies on the bed of arrows, he reflects on the impermanence of life and the role of Time. He acknowledges that Time is the cause of the preservation of all beings, as it allows for growth, change, and progression.\\n\\n3. In the Anushasana Parva, Bhishma explains to Yudhishthira that Time is the controller of all actions and the cause of the preservation of all creatures. He highlights that Time is the basis for the cycles of Yugas, ensuring the continuity of the universe.\\n\\nIn summary, the concept of Time in the Mahabharata is portrayed as a dual-natured entity, serving both as a destroyer and preserver. Time is depicted as an irresistible force that leads to the annihilation of powerful dynasties and individuals, while also being the foundation and controller of the universe, ensuring the continuity of life and order.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Analyze how the concept of Time (Kala) is portrayed as both a destroyer and preserver throughout the epic, using specific examples from different parvas?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"1\\n\\nOm!

When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nanyone.

Understanding\\n\\nthat the son of Pritha was deprived of consciousness, the deities, with\\n\\nhearts penetrated by fear, began to seek his welfare by uttering diverse\\n\\nbenedictions. Then the celestial Rishis, the seven Rishis, and the\\n\\nregenerate Rishis, became engaged in silent recitations from desire of\\n\\ngiving victory to Pritha's son of great intelligence.

The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son.

Both are sons of Kunti, making them brothers, but they end up on opposite sides of the Kurukshetra war due to circumstances and political machinations.\\n\\nSimilarities:\\n\\n1. Archery Skills: Both Karna and Arjuna are masters of archery, considered among the best in their time. They have both undergone rigorous training and have proven themselves multiple times in various battles and competitions.\\n2. Valor and Virtues: They are equally brave and have a strong sense of duty and honor. They are both willing to lay down their lives for what they believe in.\\n3. Loyalty: Both are extremely loyal, Arjuna to his brothers and Karna to Duryodhana, despite knowing that the latter is in the wrong.\\n4. Tragic Figures: Both characters have tragic elements in their stories. Arjuna has to deal with the guilt of killing his own kin, while Karna is denied his rightful place in society and is ultimately killed by Arjuna.\\n\\nDifferences:\\n\\n1. Upbringing: Karna is raised by a charioteer family, while Arjuna grows up in a royal household. This difference shapes their perspectives and attitudes towards life.\\n2. Treatment by Society: Karna faces societal discrimination and prejudice due to his birth, while Arjuna enjoys the privileges of being a prince.\\n3. Duty and Personal Desires: Karna is bound by his duty towards Duryodhana, even when it goes against his personal beliefs. Arjuna, on the other hand, struggles with his duty as a warrior and his personal desires, as seen in the Bhagavad Gita when he contemplates not fighting the war.\\n4. Relationship with Krishna: Arjuna has a deep spiritual connection with Krishna, who guides him throughout the war. Karna, despite his admiration for Krishna, is on the opposing side.\\n\\nParallel Journeys:\\n\\nTheir parallel journeys contribute to the epic's themes of duty, honor, morality, and the complexities of human relationships. Their stories highlight the impact of upbringing, societal expectations, and personal choices on their lives. They also showcase the consequences of loyalty, both when it is justified and misplaced. Their tragic ends serve as a reminder of the devastating effects of war and the importance of making wise decisions.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Karna and Arjuna are complex characters with many similarities and differences.

During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake.

During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart. Purity of actions generates energy,\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra. 'O king, a confidential agent of mine residing in Dwaraka came to\\n\\nme. He had seen Arjuna, that foremost of Pandu's sons. Indeed, the latter\\n\\nhas been very much emaciated with the fatigue of many battles. O puissant\\n\\ndeep affliction. The servants of the Vrishnis, their horsemen, and their\\n\\ncar-warriors too, followed the procession. The citizens and the\\n\\ninhabitants of the country, at the command of Prithas son, set out at the\\n\\nsame time and proceeded, surrounding that cavalcade destitute of heroes\\n\\nand numbering only women and the aged and the children. The warriors who\\n\\nfought from the backs of elephants proceeded on elephants as huge as\\n\\nhills. The foot-soldiers also set out, together with the reserves. The\\n\\nchildren of the Andhaka and the Vrishni races, all followed Arjuna. The\\n\\nBrahmanas and Kshatriyas, and Vaisyas, and wealthy Sudras, set out,\\n\\nkeeping before them the 16,000 women that had formed Vasudevas harem, and\\n\\nVajra, the grandson of the intelligent Krishna. The widows of the other\\n\\nheroes of the Bhoja, the Vrishni, and the Andhaka races, lordless now,\\n\\nthat set out with Arjuna, numbered many millions.

Maireya wines, fish of\\n\\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\\n\\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\\n\\ngreat happiness in that forest.

After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\\n\\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava forcetook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle.

During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nand every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\\n\\ngreat happiness in that forest.

During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\\n\\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\\n\\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\\n\\njust never said anything to this.

In Mahabharata, Kauravas had centralized leadership there was only one head at a time of eleven divisions. Organizational Structure of Kaurvas On the other hand, Pandavas have opted decentralized system. Lord Krishna was the supreme guide. Arjuna was the supreme commander. Dhrshtadymna was commander in chief of seven commanders. The Pandavas made seven commanders for the seven divisions. The army of Pandavas was decentralized in to seven divisions called as Akshauhini.

Mahabharata illustrate very effective strategic management principles. During the war when Arjuna has to cut off the head of Jyadharatha then Krishna advised him to take off the head of Jyadharatha and let it fall on the lap of his father Vriddhakshatra because latter had a boon from Lord Shiva that the head of the person, who will fall the head of Jyadharatha on ground, will be broken in to pieces. Krishna had a lot of knowledge, information, idea and hence problem solving skills. On the basis of these skills he had given a wonderful strategic advice to arjuna. Arjuna implemented the advice and cut the Jyadharatha head and let it fall to Vriddhakshatra\\u2019s lap who was meditating at that time and Vriddhakshatra threw\\n\\nbut his half knowledge cost him his life. The fact that he relied his defence on his 3 pandava uncles, whom he considered superior to him in warfare was a costly mistake. Inference: Be careful while you practice your application of knowledge in real life. Also, do not blindly trust your resources, you never know when they will fail. Even the best needs a mentor \\u2013 Arjuna Arjuna is one of the best warriors, on the parallels of Bheesma and Drona. He has all kinds of weapons which he had obtained from Indra but nevertheless, he seeks a mentor \\u2013 Krishna. He is not overconfident, he is not stubborn. He knows the value of proper guidance. It is the combination of Arjuna and Krishna that wins (Nara + Narayana), not Arjuna alone. Without mentorship and proper guidance, even the best resource is directionless and cannot be used with supreme efficiency. Inference: Seek a mentor, no matter how talented you are. Stubbornness is not wise. You cannot have everything in Life \\u2013 Duryodhana Duryodhana\\n\\nassisted by the twins. The foremost of all men, viz., Govinda, came\\n\\nthere, accompanied by the Vrishnis, and with Valadeva in the van. He was\\n\\naccompanied by Yuyudhana and Pradyumna and Gada, and Nisatha and Samvo\\n\\nand Kritavarman. The mighty car-warrior Bhima offered them the most\\n\\nreverential worship. Those princes then entered the palaces, adorned with\\n\\ngems, that were assigned to them. At the end of a conversation he had\\n\\nwith Yudhishthira, the slayer of Madhu referred to Arjuna who had been\\n\\nemaciated in consequence of many fights. The son of Kunti repeatedly\\n\\nasked Krishna, that chastiser of foes, about Arjuna. Unto Dharma's son,\\n\\nthe lord of all the universe began to speak about Jishnu, the son of\\n\\nSakra.

Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons.

The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nDrona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his superiority over Arjuna. Aswathama \\u2013 fighting to support his father Drona. Shakuni \\u2013 Favors Duryodhana but not interested in Hastinapur\\u2019s throne. His only interest is to spoonfeed Duryodhana in the battlefield. Pandavas were one team with one Goal. Everyone listened to Krishna\\u2019s strategies while as warriors they were in complete awe of Bhima and Arjuna. Most of them were close relatives \\u2013 cousins, brothers-in-law, fathers-in-law. More than that they all were part of the decision-making process. It was their \\u201ccommon\\u201d war. Inference: The strength lies in team work and not in individual efforts. Know your competitors weakness and exploit it silently: Yudhisitira There is a reason why Yudhistira got that name \\u2013 he is always calm and composed in the battlefield (Yudh mein sthir = Yudhisthir)\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins.

He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart.

Among the tribes of the Saddhyas, the gods, the Viswedevas, and the Maruts, behold, O king of kings, the mighty car-warriors of the Vrishnis and the Andhakas, viz., those heroes having Satyaki for their first, and those mighty ones among the Bhojas. Behold the son of Subhadra, invincible in battle, now staying with Soma. Even he is the mighty bowman Abhimanyu, now endued with the gentle effulgence of the great luminary of the night. Here is the mighty bowman Pandu, now united with Kunti and Madri. Thy sire frequently comes to me on his excellent car. Behold the royal Bhishma, the son of Santanu, now in the\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava force\\n\\nviz., the Pandavas of wide chests. They said, 'We wish to know who\\n\\namongst these is Yudhishthira, who are Bhima and Arjuna, who the twins,\\n\\nand who is Draupadi of great fame.' Then the Suta, Sanjaya, in answer to\\n\\ntheir queries, pointed out to them the Pandavas. naming each, and\\n\\nDraupadi too as also the other ladies of the Kuru household.'\\n\\n\\\"Sanjaya said, 'This one that is as fair of complexion as pure gold, that\\n\\nis endued with a body which looks like that of a full-grown lion, that is\\n\\npossessed of a large aquiline nose, and wide and expansive eyes that are,\\n\\nagain, of a coppery hue, is the Kuru king.

Yudhishthira made over the kingdom to the son of his uncle by his Vaisya wife. Installing Parikshit also on their throne, as king, the eldest brother of the Pandavas, filled with sorrow, addressed Subhadra, saying, This son of thy son will be the king of the Kurus.

Her character is a testament to the importance of women's participation in decision-making and leadership. As the wife of the Pandavas, Draupadi plays a crucial role in binding the brothers together, providing emotional support, and offering counsel. Her presence in the decision-making process helps the Pandavas achieve higher and sustainable goals.\\n\\nDraupadi's actions and choices also reflect the epic's views on gender and power. Her rejection of Karna, despite his possessing all the qualities she desired in a husband, highlights her pride and attachment to her own social status. This decision has significant consequences, as Karna becomes a key player in the war, ultimately fighting on the side of the Kauravas. Draupadi's choices also demonstrate her capacity for self-preservation and her willingness to manipulate situations to her advantage.\\n\\n**Kunti:**\\n\\nKunti, the mother of the Pandavas, is a powerful figure in the Mahabharata, embodying the qualities of a wise and compassionate leader. As the supreme authority, Kunti's words are law, and her sons obey her without question.

As the wife of Dhritarashtra, Gandhari is a symbol of feminine loyalty and devotion. Her actions and choices reflect the epic's views on the importance of women's roles in maintaining social order and upholding dharma.\\n\\nGandhari's relationship with Kunti is particularly noteworthy, as the two women navigate their complex roles as mothers and wives. Despite their differences, they maintain a sense of respect and admiration for one another, highlighting the importance of feminine relationships in the epic.\\n\\n**The Epic's Views on Gender, Power, and Dharma:**\\n\\nThe Mahabharata presents a nuanced view of gender, power, and dharma, reflecting the complexities of ancient Indian society. The epic highlights the importance of women's participation in decision-making and leadership, as well as their roles in maintaining social order and upholding dharma.\\n\\nThe character of Draupadi, in particular, showcases the epic's views on the feminine, sustainable traits that balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits.

The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker.

King Vabhruvahana, however, with\\n\\noff those arrows of sharp and terrible points, resembling snakes of\\n\\nvirulent poison, before they could come up to him. Having cut off those\\n\\nsharp arrows equipt with Kanka feathers, Arjuna pierced each of the\\n\\nwarriors opposed to him with a whetted shaft. The Saindhava Kshatriyas,\\n\\nrecollecting that it was Dhananjaya who had slain their king Jayadratha,\\n\\nthen hurled at him darts and javelins with great force. The diadem-decked\\n\\nDhananjaya of great might baffled their intent by cutting off all those\\n\\nweapons before any of them could reach him. At length the son of Pandu\\n\\nbecame highly angry. With many straight and broad-headed arrows, he\\n\\nfelled the heads of many of those warriors who were rushing at him from\\n\\ndesire of victory. Many fled, many rushed at Arjuna; many moved not, all\\n\\nof them, however, uttered such aloud noise (of wrath and grief) that it\\n\\nresembled the roar of the ocean. As they were slain by Partha of\\n\\nbeen slain before on the field of Kurukshetra. Recollecting these\\n\\ncommands of king Yudhishthira the just who was endued with great\\n\\nintelligence, Arjuna asked the Trigartas to forbear. But they disregarded\\n\\nArjuna's injunction. Then Arjuna vanquished Suryavarman, the king of the\\n\\nTrigartas, in battle, by shooting countless shafts at him and laughed in\\n\\nscorn. The Trigarta warriors, however, filling the ten points with the\\n\\nclatter of their cars and car-wheels, rushed towards Dhananjaya. Then\\n\\nSuryavarman, displaying his great lightness of hand, pierced Dhananjaya\\n\\nwith hundreds of straight arrows, O monarch. The other great bowmen who\\n\\nfollowed the king and who were all desirous of compassing the destruction\\n\\nof Dhananjaya, shot showers of arrows on him. With countless shafts shot\\n\\nfrom his own bow-siring, the son of Pandu, O king, cut off those clouds\\n\\nof arrows; upon which they fell down. Endued with great energy,\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,\"]}": {

The story begins with the Pandavas, led by Yudhishthira, proceeding to a spot on the margin of the Ganga River, where they bathed in the sacred stream. After finishing their ablutions, they turned their faces towards their retreat, but a fierce forest conflagration set in, burning the forest and its inhabitants, including herds of animals and snakes.\\n\\nThe king, who had taken no food, was unable to move or exert himself due to the intense heat and smoke. His two mothers, also emaciated, were unable to move. The king, seeing the conflagration approach him from all sides, instructed his charioteer, Sanjaya, to find a safe place to escape the fire.\\n\\nHowever, it is revealed later that the king had actually caused the sacrificial fires to be ignited in the woods, and after performing his sacred rites, he abandoned them. The Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off the fires in a solitary part of the woods, and they grew into a general conflagration in the forest.\\n\\nThe deity of fire, pleased with the king's devotion, blazed up and consumed everything in its path. The smoke from the fire threatened terrors to the world of Nagas, and the palaces of the Airavatas were enveloped in gloom. The cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions of the Nagas, and the palaces resembled woods and hills overwhelmed by a thick forest.\\n\\nThe immediate consequences of the burning of the Khandava Forest were the destruction of the forest and its inhabitants, including the Nagas and other creatures. The long-term consequences were the emergence of the Pandavas, who were forced to flee the forest and eventually led to the great war of the Mahabharata.\\n\\nThe burning of the Khandava Forest also had a significant impact on the Pandavas, particularly Arjuna, who was instrumental in the burning of the forest. The deity of fire, pleased with Arjuna's devotion, granted him a boon, which would later play a crucial role in the war of the Mahabharata.\\n\\nThe burning of the Khandava Forest is also seen as a symbol of the destructive power of the divine and the inevitability of fate. The forest, which was once a thriving ecosystem, was reduced to ashes, and its inhabitants were destroyed. This event serves as a reminder of the transience of life and the powerlessness of human beings against the forces of nature and fate.\\n\\nIn terms of the lessons that can be learned from this event, it highlights the importance of managing risk and avoiding difficulties and closure of business. The burning of the Khandava Forest was a catastrophic event that had far-reaching consequences, and it serves as a reminder of the importance of careful planning and management.\\n\\nThe win-win approach, which is another lesson that can be learned from the Mahabharata, is also relevant to this event. The deity of fire, pleased with the king's devotion, granted him a boon, which was a win-win situation for both the king and the deity. This approach, which involves achieving the wellbeing of all stakeholders, is a key principle of inclusive development and is essential for resolving rivalries and achieving a peaceful resolution.\\n\\nFinally, the burning of the Khandava Forest highlights the importance of strategic thinking and planning. The king's decision to cause the sacrificial fires to be ignited in the woods, and the deity of fire's subsequent action, demonstrate the importance of careful planning and management in achieving desired outcomes.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Describe the events leading up to and including the burning of the Khandava Forest.

I have heard this there. I tell thee, O Bharata, such has not been\\n\\nthe fate of Vichitraviryya. It has been heard by us that when the old\\n\\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\\n\\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\\n\\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nrace, duly and with a pure heart and body. For that reason I shall\\n\\naccomplish what is for thy good. Do my bidding without delay.' Thus\\n\\naddressed by the deity of fire, Utanka did as he was directed. The deity\\n\\nthen, gratified with him, blazed up for consuming everything. From the\\n\\npores of his body, O Bharata, in consequence of his very nature, a thick\\n\\nsmoke issued threatening terrors to the world of Nagas. With that mighty\\n\\nand wide-spreading smoke, O Bharata, everything became enveloped in\\n\\ngloom, so that nothing, O king, could any longer be seen in the world of\\n\\nthe Nagas. Cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions of the\\n\\nAiravatas, uttered by the Nagas headed by Vasuki, O Janamejaya. Enveloped\\n\\nby that smoke, the palaces could no longer be seen, O Bharata. These\\n\\nresembled woods and hill overwhelmed by a thick forest. With eyes that\\n\\nwere red in consequence of that smoke, and afflicted by the energy of the\\n\\n\\\"Proceeding on, those heroes reached the sea of red waters. Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire. The forest of Khandava was burnt by me, through the puissance of Arjuna and of Narayana himself. Let your brother Phalguna proceed to the woods after casting off Gandiva, that high weapon. He has no longer any need of it. That precious discus, which was with the high-souled Krishna, has disappeared (from the world).another in that fearful melee. Indeed, O king, whoever amongst them took\\n\\nup in wrath a few blades of the Eraka grass, these, in his hands, became\\n\\nsoon converted into a thunderbolt, O puissant one. Every blade of grass\\n\\nthere was seen to be converted into a terrible iron bolt. All this, know,\\n\\nO king, was due to the curse denounced by Brahmanas. He who hurled a\\n\\nblade of grass saw that it pierced through even such things as were\\n\\nutterly impenetrable. In fact, every blade was seen to become a terrible\\n\\nbolt having the force of thunder. Son killed sire, and sire killed son, O\\n\\nBharata. Inebriated with wine, they rushed and fell upon one another. The\\n\\nKukuras and the Andhakas met with destruction like insects rushing at a\\n\\nblazing fire. As they were thus being slaughtered, no one among them\\n\\nthought of escaping by fight. Knowing that the hour of destruction had\\n\\ncome, the mighty-armed Keshava stood there, eyeing everything. Indeed,\\n\\nthe forest). And he said, 'Cease, O son, great has been my toil.' Having\\n\\nsaid these words, the old king entered the apartments of Gandhari. Unto\\n\\nthat husband of hers who resembled a second Lord of all creatures, while\\n\\nresting on a seat, Gandhari of righteous conduct, conversant with the\\n\\nopportuneness of everything, said these words, the hour being suited to\\n\\nthem,--'Thou hast obtained the permission of that great Rishi, viz.,\\n\\nVyasa himself. When, however, wilt thou go to the forest, with the\\n\\npermission of Yudhishthira?'\\n\\n\\\"Dhritarashtra said, 'O Gandhari, I have received the permission of my\\n\\nhigh-souled sire. With the permission of Yudhishthira (next obtained), I\\n\\nshall soon retire into the woods. I desire, however, to give away some\\n\\nwealth capable of following the status of Preta, in respect of all those\\n\\nsons of mine who were addicted to calamitous dice. Verily, I desire to\\n\\nmake those gifts, inviting all the people to my mansion.'[26]\\n\\npleased, at the command of Dhritarashtra. He beheld many sacrificial\\n\\naltars with sacred fires blazing on them and with many ascetics seated on\\n\\nthem, that had performed their oblations and poured libations in honour\\n\\nof the deities. Those altars were overspread with fruits and roots of the\\n\\nforest, and with heaps of flowers. The smoke of clarified butter curled\\n\\nupwards from them. They were graced, besides, with many ascetics\\n\\npossessed of bodies that looked like the embodied Vedas and with many\\n\\nthat belonged to the lay brotherhood. Herds of deer were grazing, or\\n\\nresting here and there, freed from every fear. Innumerable birds also\\n\\nwere there, engaged in uttering their melodious notes, O king. The whole\\n\\nforest seemed to resound with the notes of peacocks and Datyuhas and\\n\\nKokilas and the sweet songs of other warblers.[43] Some spots echoed with\\n\\nthe chant of Vedic hymns recited by learned Brahmanas. Some were adorned\\n\\nand every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The win-win approach The win win approach is another lesson that we learn from Mahabharata. This is the approach which every corporate advisors, management guru and professional consultant suggest to opt. This approach will lead to wellbeing of all the stakeholders and hence inclusive development. Every corporate should try to achieve inclusive development through every possible way like persuasion, reward, discrimination or threat. This may resolve all possible rivalries. Before the battle of Mahabharata, Krishna went to Hastinapur for conveying the message of Pandavas to negotiate an agreement for the wellbeing of all i.e. for wellbeing of Pandavas, Kauravas and whole community. He tried his level best for achieving a win win situation to avoid the battle of Mahabharata. 3.9 Strategic\"]}": {

This event is seen as a demonstration of Time's power to bring about the downfall of even the most powerful individuals.\\n3. **The Death of Krishna**: In the Bhishma Parva, Krishna's ascension to Heaven is described as a result of Time's influence. Krishna's death is seen as a manifestation of Time's power to bring about the end of even the most revered individuals.\\n\\n**Preserver:**\\n\\n1. **The Preservation of the Pandavas**: In the Bhishma Parva, the Pandavas are preserved from the destruction of the Vrishnis and the Kauravas, despite being present at the scene. This is attributed to the influence of Time, which preserves the Pandavas as part of its larger plan.\\n2. **The Protection of Arjuna**: In the Drona Parva, Arjuna is protected from the attacks of the Saindhava warriors, despite being senseless and defenseless.

The sound is said to be a harbinger of doom, but also a sign of Time's power to bring about change and renewal.\\n2. **The Constellations and Planets**: In the Bhishma Parva, the constellations and planets are described as being struck by Time, which is both destructive and preservative. The event is seen as a manifestation of Time's power to bring about change and renewal.\\n3. **The Worms and Insects**: In the Bhishma Parva, the appearance of worms and insects is described as a sign of Time's influence, which is both destructive and preservative.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata in several ways. On one hand, Bhishma's decision to renounce sex and marry his father's wife, Satyavati, demonstrates his commitment to fulfilling his duty as a son and a member of the royal family. By sacrificing his personal desires and taking a vow of celibacy, Bhishma prioritizes his father's happiness and the continuation of the royal lineage.\\n\\nHowever, as the story unfolds, Bhishma's decision also highlights the limitations and potential consequences of prioritizing duty over personal desire. Despite his initial intention to renounce sex, Bhishma's vow ultimately leads to a series of events that result in the birth of two weak and feeble children, Dhritarashtra and Pandu. This outcome suggests that Bhishma's decision may have been motivated by a sense of duty rather than a genuine desire to fulfill his father's happiness.\\n\\nFurthermore, Bhishma's refusal to reconsider his vow and produce children, despite the queen's requests, demonstrates the rigidity and inflexibility of his commitment to duty. This inflexibility ultimately leads to the downfall of the royal family and the kingdom, highlighting the potential consequences of prioritizing duty over personal desire and context.\\n\\nIn this sense, Bhishma's story serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of considering context and personal desire when making decisions about duty and responsibility. While duty and responsibility are essential aspects of life, they must be balanced with personal desire and a willingness to adapt to changing circumstances.\\n\\nThe Mahabharata's portrayal of Bhishma's vow also raises questions about the nature of duty and personal desire. Is duty solely a matter of fulfilling one's obligations to others, or can it also involve prioritizing one's own desires and well-being? How can individuals balance their sense of duty with their personal desires and aspirations? These questions are central to the Mahabharata's exploration of the human condition and the complexities of duty, desire, and responsibility.\\n\\nUltimately, Bhishma's story in the Mahabharata serves as a reminder that duty and personal desire are not mutually exclusive, but rather interconnected aspects of human experience. By considering the complexities of Bhishma's vow and its consequences, readers can gain a deeper understanding of the importance of balancing duty and personal desire in their own lives.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"Lessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life.

So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness.

Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nshould motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning. When Arjuna was in confusion whether he should fight against his own cousins. At that time, he decided not to fight against his own relatives, and then Lord Krishna motivated him and guided him to choose the righteous action. This help Pandavas to won the battle of Mahabharata. 3.19 Right man for right job Efficient managers distribute work according to potential of members. Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager. He formulated all the strategies during the war which led Pandavas to victory. 4. Summary It can be summarized from above forth discussion that one should focus on all his deeds with pure heart.

This dual nature of Time is exemplified through various episodes and characters, highlighting its role in shaping the lives of individuals and the course of events.\\n\\n**Time as a Destroyer:**\\n\\n1. **The destruction of the Vrishnis and Andhakas**: The epic describes the downfall of the Vrishni and Andhaka clans, which is attributed to the curse of the Brahmanas and the subsequent battle with iron bolts. This event is seen as a manifestation of Time's destructive power, where even the mighty warriors of these clans are unable to escape their fate.\\n2. **The fall of the Pandavas**: The Mahabharata also portrays the decline of the Pandavas, who, despite their victories and accomplishments, ultimately succumb to the ravages of Time. Their kingdom, Hastinapura, is eventually abandoned, and they embark on their final journey, marking the end of their era.\\n3. **The demise of individual characters**: Time is also shown to be responsible for the demise of individual characters, such as Bhishma, Drona, and Karna. Their deaths serve as a reminder that Time is an unstoppable force that ultimately claims the lives of all beings.\\n\\n**Time as a Preserver:**\\n\\n1. **The preservation of the Pandavas**: Despite the many challenges and hardships they face, the Pandavas are able to survive and thrive due to the guidance and protection of Lord Krishna, who is often depicted as a manifestation of Time itself. Krishna's interventions and counsel help the Pandavas navigate the complexities of Time and ultimately achieve their goals.\\n2. **The continuation of the lineage**: The Mahabharata also highlights the importance of Time in preserving the lineage of the Pandavas. The epic describes the birth of Parikshit, the son of Abhimanyu, who becomes the heir to the throne and ensures the continuation of the Pandava dynasty.\\n3. **The cyclical nature of Time**: The epic suggests that Time is cyclical, with events repeating themselves in a never-ending cycle. This is evident in the story of the Mahabharata itself, which is presented as a retelling of the events of the past, highlighting the idea that Time is a continuous and interconnected web.\\n\\n**Examples from different parvas:**\\n\\n1. **The Sabha Parva**: In this parva, the Mahabharata describes the game of dice, which serves as a catalyst for the events that unfold. The game is often seen as a manifestation of Time's destructive power, as it leads to the downfall of the Pandavas and the eventual war.\\n2. **The Bhishma Parva**: This parva describes the battle of Kurukshetra and the fall of Bhishma. Bhishma's death serves as a reminder of the inevitability of Time and the impermanence of human life.\\n3. **The Anushasana Parva**: In this parva, the Mahabharata presents a philosophical discussion on the nature of Time and its role in shaping human destiny. The parva highlights the importance of understanding and accepting the cyclical nature of Time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the concept of Time (Kala) is a complex and multifaceted theme in the Mahabharata, depicted as both a destroyer and preserver.

I think that what has happened is due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all).

When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nanyone. Why then, O chief of Bharatas race, this exceedingly dejected\\n\\naspect? It behoveth thee, O son of Pritha, to tell me all, if, indeed,\\n\\nthere be no harm in telling it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Arjuna said, He whose complexion was like that of a (newly-risen) cloud,\\n\\nhe whose eyes were like a pair of large lotus petals, Krishna, has, with\\n\\nRama, cast off his body and ascended to Heaven. At Prabhasa, through iron\\n\\nbolts generated by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has\\n\\ntaken place of the Vrishni heroes. Awful hath that carnage been, and not\\n\\neven a single hero has escaped. The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and\\n\\nthe Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all endued with high souls, great\\n\\nmight, and leonine pride, have slaughtered one another in battle.\\n\\nPossessed of arms that looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing\\n\\nthe strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with\\n\\nblades of Eraka grass. Behold the perverse course of Time. 500,000\\n\\nstupefied, the Saindhava warriors once more shot at that senseless\\n\\nwarrior, without loss of time, innumerable other shafts. Understanding\\n\\nthat the son of Pritha was deprived of consciousness, the deities, with\\n\\nhearts penetrated by fear, began to seek his welfare by uttering diverse\\n\\nbenedictions. Then the celestial Rishis, the seven Rishis, and the\\n\\nregenerate Rishis, became engaged in silent recitations from desire of\\n\\ngiving victory to Pritha's son of great intelligence. When at last the\\n\\nenergy of Partha blazed forth through those acts of the denizens of\\n\\nHeaven, that hero, who was conversant with celestial weapons of high\\n\\nefficacy, stood immovable like a hill. The delighter of the Kurus then\\n\\ndrew his celestial bow. And as he repeatedly stretched the bowstring, the\\n\\ntwang that followed resembled the loud sound of some mighty machine. Like\\n\\nPurandara pouring rain, the puissant Arjuna then, with that bow of his,Hastinapur to save their lives. Another episode of Mahabharata also indicate the need of future forecasting to take safeguard measures- when Bheema was going to search Ashwathama alone, then Krishna advised Yudhishthra to accompany Bheema to protect him. This was done on the basis of forecasting by Krishna that Ashwathama may use terrible \\u2018Brahamishra\\u2019 weapon on Bheema. Therefore, effective management needs simultaneously Pro-activity, Pre-activity, Process-activity and Post-activity. 3.7 Calculated Risk A fundamental rule of effective management is to take optimum level of risk and not to gamble. Firms should not put all their assets on risk. In gambling event, Pandvas loose Indraprastha, all their assets and even Draupadi. This was the worst situation in their life due to putting their each and every thing on stake. Perhaps this was the major cause of the balltle of Mahabhata. This incident teaches us the lesson of managing risk to avoid difficulties and closure of business. 3.8 The\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nalso, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\"]}": {

Impressed by Arjuna's devotion, Lord Shiva appeared before him and gifted him the Pashupatastra, a powerful divine missile that could destroy any target.\\n\\n2. **Brahmashira**: Arjuna received the Brahmashira from Drona, his guru. The Brahmashira was a powerful divine missile that could destroy the entire universe. Drona taught Arjuna how to use the Brahmashira, but also warned him to use it only in extreme circumstances.\\n\\n3. **Anjalika**: Arjuna received the Anjalika from Drona.

Vayu gifted him the Vayavyastra, a divine missile that could control the winds and destroy any target.\\n\\n7. **Agni Astra**: Arjuna received the Agni Astra from Agni, the god of fire.

The forest was a dense and sacred place, inhabited by various creatures, including the Nagas (serpents) and other animals.\\n\\nThe immediate cause of the burning of the Khandava Forest was the deity of fire, Agni, who was hungry and needed to consume the forest to sustain himself. Agni had been unable to consume the forest earlier due to the presence of the god Indra, who had been protecting it.\\n\\nAgni approached Arjuna and Krishna, who were passing by the forest, and asked for their help in burning it down. Arjuna and Krishna agreed to help Agni, and they used their combined strength to create a massive fire that engulfed the forest.\\n\\nThe burning of the Khandava Forest had several immediate consequences. The forest and its inhabitants were destroyed, and the creatures that lived there were forced to flee or perish. The fire was so intense that it even affected the nearby kingdom of Takshasila.\\n\\nThe long-term consequences of the burning of the Khandava Forest were significant. The destruction of the forest led to the creation of a new landscape, which became the site of the city of Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas. The burning of the forest also led to the creation of a new ecosystem, which supported the growth of new plants and animals.\\n\\nThe burning of the Khandava Forest also had spiritual and symbolic significance. It represented the destruction of the old and the creation of the new, and it marked the beginning of a new era for the Pandavas. The fire also symbolized the power of Agni, who was revered as a deity in Hindu mythology.\\n\\nIn addition, the burning of the Khandava Forest had a profound impact on the characters involved. Arjuna and Krishna's actions demonstrated their bravery and strength, and their willingness to help Agni marked the beginning of their close relationship.

It has been heard by us that when the old\\n\\nking endued with great intelligence and subsisting on air alone entered\\n\\nthe woods (after his return from Gangadwara), he caused his sacrificial\\n\\nfires to be duly ignited. Having performed his sacred rites therewith, he\\n\\nabandoned them all. Then the Yajaka Brahmanas he had with him cast off\\n\\nthose fires in a solitary part of the woods and went away as they liked\\n\\non other errands, O foremost one of Bharata's race. The fire thus cast\\n\\noff grew in the woods. It then produced a general conflagration in the\\n\\nforest. Even this is what I have heard from the ascetics dwelling on the\\n\\nrace, duly and with a pure heart and body. For that reason I shall\\n\\naccomplish what is for thy good. Do my bidding without delay.' Thus\\n\\naddressed by the deity of fire, Utanka did as he was directed. The deity\\n\\nthen, gratified with him, blazed up for consuming everything. From the\\n\\npores of his body, O Bharata, in consequence of his very nature, a thick\\n\\nsmoke issued threatening terrors to the world of Nagas. With that mighty\\n\\nand wide-spreading smoke, O Bharata, everything became enveloped in\\n\\ngloom, so that nothing, O king, could any longer be seen in the world of\\n\\nthe Nagas. Cries of woe were heard throughout the mansions of the\\n\\nAiravatas, uttered by the Nagas headed by Vasuki, O Janamejaya. Enveloped\\n\\nby that smoke, the palaces could no longer be seen, O Bharata. These\\n\\nresembled woods and hill overwhelmed by a thick forest.

Dhananjaya had not cast off his celestial bow Gandiva, nor his couple of inexhaustible quivers, actuated, O king, by the cupidity that attaches one to things of great value. The Pandavas there beheld the deity of fire standing before them like a hill. Closing their way, the god stood there in his embodied form. The deity of seven flames then addressed the Pandavas, saying, Ye heroic sons of Pandu, know me for the deity of fire. O mighty-armed Yudhishthira, O Bhimasena that art a scorcher of foes, O Arjuna, and ye twins of great courage, listen to what I say! Ye foremost ones of Kurus race, I am the god of fire.

As the divine being with unparalleled powers, his involvement would have made the war unwinnable for the Kauravas, and the Pandavas would have won easily. However, Krishna's goal was not just to ensure the Pandavas' victory but also to minimize the destruction and bloodshed.\\n\\nSecondly, Krishna wanted to test Arjuna's abilities and character. By being Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna could guide and advise Arjuna, helping him to make the right decisions and develop his skills as a warrior. This approach allowed Arjuna to grow and learn from his experiences, ultimately becoming a better warrior and a more confident leader.\\n\\nThirdly, Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer was also a demonstration of his humility and willingness to serve. As the divine being, Krishna could have easily taken center stage and fought the war himself. However, he chose to take a supporting role, highlighting the importance of teamwork, collaboration, and servant leadership.\\n\\nLastly, Krishna's presence as Arjuna's charioteer allowed him to preach the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna, imparting valuable lessons on spirituality, morality, and leadership. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna has become one of the most revered and influential texts in Hindu philosophy, offering insights into the nature of reality, duty, and the human condition.\\n\\nIn summary, Krishna chose to be Arjuna's charioteer rather than fight in the war himself to minimize destruction, test Arjuna's abilities, demonstrate humility, and impart valuable lessons on spirituality and leadership.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Why did Krishna choose to be Arjuna's charioteer rather than fight in the war himself?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"should motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning.

Managers should efficiently utilize the potential, energies and capabilities of their team. Pandavas had efficiently utilised the energies of each and every member of their army. Moreover, Pandavas had chosen Lord Krishna instead of his entire army force because Lord Krishna is known as greatest crisis manager.

Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nDrona is fighting for Hastinapur\\u2019s salt and Drupad\\u2019s revenge Kripacharya is fighting to help Drona Shalya \\u2013 Tricked by Duryodhana, he wanted to fight for Pandavas. Karna \\u2013 Fighting to prove his superiority over Arjuna. Aswathama \\u2013 fighting to support his father Drona. Shakuni \\u2013 Favors Duryodhana but not interested in Hastinapur\\u2019s throne. His only interest is to spoonfeed Duryodhana in the battlefield. Pandavas were one team with one Goal. Everyone listened to Krishna\\u2019s strategies while as warriors they were in complete awe of Bhima and Arjuna. Most of them were close relatives \\u2013 cousins, brothers-in-law, fathers-in-law. More than that they all were part of the decision-making process. It was their \\u201ccommon\\u201d war. Inference: The strength lies in team work and not in individual efforts. Know your competitors weakness and exploit it silently: Yudhisitira There is a reason why Yudhistira got that name \\u2013 he is always calm and composed in the battlefield (Yudh mein sthir = Yudhisthir)\"]}": {

In the final round, he wagered Draupadi, his wife, and lost her as well.\\n\\nThe conditions of the game were unfair, as Shakuni was using loaded dice to cheat Yudhishthira. The Kauravas, led by Duryodhana, took advantage of Yudhishthira's losses and humiliated the Pandavas, leading to the eventual exile of the Pandavas and the events that unfolded in the Mahabharata.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that the context provided does not mention the specific conditions of the dice game, but it does mention the events that led to the war between the Pandavas and Kauravas, including the humiliation of Draupadi by the Kauravas.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"What were the conditions of the dice game between the Pandavas and Kauravas, and what was wagered in each round?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle.

A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\\n\\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\\n\\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\\n\\njust never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of\\n\\nAmvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great\\n\\nenergy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and\\n\\njuice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as\\n\\nbefore.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse\\n\\nkinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of\\n\\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\\n\\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\\n\\ngreat happiness in that forest. Towards the close of that period, O\\n\\nsinless one, Vyasa came there. While all those princes sat around Vyasa,\\n\\nengaged in conversation on diverse subjects, other Rishis came to that\\n\\nspot. They were Narada, and Parvata and Devala of austere penances, and\\n\\nViswavasu and Tumvuru, and Chitrasena., O Bharata. Endued with severe\\n\\npenances, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, with the permission of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, worshipped them according to due rites. Having obtained\\n\\nthat worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats\\n\\n(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock\\n\\nfeathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\\n\\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava forcetook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength.

All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\"]}": {

        "{\"actual_output\": \"The Mahabharata, one of the most revered epics in Hindu mythology, presents a complex and multifaceted portrayal of women, their roles, and their agency. This examination will focus on the characters of Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari, exploring how their actions and choices drive the narrative and reflect the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma.\\n\\nDraupadi, the wife of the five Pandavas, is a pivotal figure in the Mahabharata. Her character embodies the contradictions and complexities of women's roles in ancient Indian society. On one hand, she is depicted as a strong-willed and independent individual who challenges the patriarchal norms of her time. Her famous speech in the Sabha Parva, where she questions the morality of her husbands' actions and the dharma of the assembly, showcases her courage and conviction. On the other hand, she is also portrayed as a victim of circumstance, forced to endure the humiliation of being disrobed in public and the subsequent war that ensues.\\n\\nDraupadi's actions and choices drive the narrative in significant ways. Her marriage to the five Pandavas, facilitated by her father Drupada, sets the stage for the epic's exploration of polyandry and the complexities of family relationships. Her subsequent humiliation at the hands of the Kauravas sparks the war that becomes the central plot of the Mahabharata. Furthermore, her relationships with her husbands, particularly Yudhishthira and Arjuna, reveal the intricacies of marriage, loyalty, and duty in ancient Indian society.\\n\\nKunti, the mother of the Pandavas, is another significant female character in the Mahabharata. Her actions and choices are instrumental in shaping the narrative and reflecting the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma. As the matriarch of the Pandava family, Kunti embodies the virtues of maternal love, loyalty, and sacrifice. Her decision to reveal the truth about Karna's parentage to him, despite the potential consequences, demonstrates her commitment to dharma and her desire to protect her family.\\n\\nKunti's character also highlights the complexities of women's roles in ancient Indian society. As a widow, she is expected to renounce worldly life and devote herself to spiritual pursuits. However, she chooses to remain involved in the lives of her sons, guiding them and advising them throughout the epic. This portrayal challenges the traditional notion of women's roles in ancient India, showcasing a strong and independent female character who defies societal expectations.\\n\\nGandhari, the wife of Dhritarashtra and the mother of the Kauravas, is a more enigmatic figure in the Mahabharata. Her character is marked by a sense of tragedy and loss, as she is forced to navigate the complexities of her family's dynamics and the consequences of her husband's actions. Her decision to blindfold herself, symbolizing her solidarity with her blind husband, is a poignant example of her devotion and loyalty.\\n\\nGandhari's actions and choices also drive the narrative in significant ways. Her attempts to intervene in the conflict between her sons and the Pandavas, particularly through her conversations with Krishna, reveal the complexities of maternal love and the difficulties of navigating family relationships. Her famous curse, which ultimately leads to the downfall of the Kauravas, serves as a reminder of the power and agency of women in ancient Indian society.\\n\\nThe Mahabharata's portrayal of these three women reflects the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma in complex and multifaceted ways. On one hand, the epic reinforces traditional patriarchal norms, depicting women as subservient to their husbands and families. However, it also challenges these norms, showcasing strong and independent female characters who defy societal expectations and exercise agency in their own lives.\\n\\nThe epic's exploration of dharma, or righteous living, is also closely tied to its portrayal of women. The characters of Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari all grapple with the complexities of dharma, navigating the tensions between personal desire, family loyalty, and societal expectations. Their actions and choices serve as a reminder that dharma is not a fixed or static concept, but rather a dynamic and context-dependent principle that must be negotiated and reinterpreted in different situations.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Mahabharata's portrayal of women, particularly Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari, reflects the epic's complex and multifaceted views on gender, power, and dharma. These characters drive the narrative in significant ways, challenging traditional patriarchal norms and showcasing the agency and independence of women in ancient Indian society. Their stories serve as a reminder of the importance of nuance and context in understanding the complexities of human relationships and the principles of righteous living.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Examine the role of women in the Mahabharata, focusing on Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari.

Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nin the battle. Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nrace, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion of Renunciation, traversed through various countries and reached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind him was Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order of their birth; behind them all, O foremost one of Bharatas race, proceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of dark complexion, and endued with eyes resembling lotus petals. While the Pandavas set out for the forest, a dog followed them.Inference: Know your competitors weaknesses and exploit them but do it silently. Women empowerment, do not neglect the opposite sex Kauravas follow a Patriarchal structure. Nowhere do we see women in the Kaurava camp except Gandhari, who is always ignored and nobody listens to whatever she says. No women in the decision making process. You dont hear many stories about Duryodhana\\u2019s wife, Dusassana\\u2019s wife or daugthers. Pandavas follow a matriarchal structure. Kunti is the final decision maker and everyone listens to her, no questions asked. Draupadi was a companion in whatever the Pandavas did. She had a big role in all the decision making. It is Draupadi who bound all the Pandavas together for 14 years. Hidimba, Bheema\\u2019s wife, sends her son Ghatotkacha to war. Uttara inspires Abhimanyu and prepares her mind for the battlefield.

Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\\n\\nprepares her mind for the battlefield. Abhimanyu was hesitant at first because he is only 16 but it is Uttara who gives him inner strength. Any team which doesn\\u2019t have women is unbalanced, for the Masculine traits of aggression and dominance should be balanced by the Feminine traits of harmony and sustenance. Inference: Strike a balance, empower women. You do not need the best man, you need the \\u201cRight\\u201d man for the Right job On the Kaurava\\u2019s side, nobody wanted the war except Duryodhana. So even if the Kaurava side was more heavy, their motive was distributed. Bheesma \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill the Pandavas, they are his grandchildren Drona \\u2013 He won\\u2019t kill Pandavas (his students) Shalya \\u2013 He was the maternal uncle of Pandavas and secretly helped them by acting as a spy. He also demotivated Karna in the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No\\n\\nLessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life. Given below are some important characters and lessons you can learn from their ideals, actions and circumstances they went through. Decision Making, Context is important \\u2013 Bheesma Devavrata (Bheesma) takes a very brave decision and does the unthinkable. I will not marry and produce children so that my father can marry the woman he loves. I will renounce sex for my father\\u2019s happiness. (Akhanda Pratigya) This is a valiant decision he took in the context of his father\\u2019s happiness. But going forward, this decision turned out to be fatal. His father\\u2019s wife, Satyavati gives birth to two children who died without fathering a child. The kingdom is without a king and hence queen Satyavati, comes back to Bheesma again and requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant. But Bheesma is tied with his vision of renouncing sex. He walks away saying I have taken this decision\"]}": {

Duryodhana is just a vehicle, Shakuni is the instrument here and sadly, Duryodhana\\u2019s parents are literally \\u201cblind\\u201d on the company their son keeps. Inference: Be very careful of the company you keep. Your company shapes up your thoughts, so choose it wisely. Dedicate yourself to a cause: Karna Karna is an exceptional character in Mahabharata. He was the eldest son of Kunti but due to unavoidable circumstances, he grew up as a charioteers son. Karna is exceptionally talented fellow, he is loyal and well built, intelligent and handsome (all the qualities Draupadi demanded from Shiva). But he never gets what he deserves. Neither the respect, nor the legacy or love. Politics was played on him time and time again but he always stood his ground. He never gets his due but he never gave up on his efforts. His courageous spirit led him to achieve impossible odds, he was no less than other Pandavas when it came to virtues and valor. Krishna and Bheesma concede that karna is a\\n\\nin the battlefield. Karna: Promised not to kill any Pandava except Arjuna. So as you see, Kauravas are nothing but a directionless team of traitors. A team without any agenda, fighting cluelessly. No organization. Pandavas had a common goal but they intelligently divided the responsibilities. They had an agenda and they picked the right man for the right job. Dhratsadyumna \\u2013 Drona. Shikhandi: Bhisma. Satayaki \\u2013 Bhurisrava. Arjuna \\u2013 Karna. Bhima \\u2013 Duryodhana and his brothers. Sahadeva \\u2013 Shakuni and his sons. Nakula \\u2013Karna\\u2019s sons. Support system \\u2013 Virat, Drupad, Chedi, Magadh, Kasi, Matsya and Naga king. Krishna \\u2013 Crisis manager and advisor. Inference: A great example of proper resource utilization. The right team is made by selecting the right Individuals. Get the right man for the right job. Your Future Does not Depend on what you \\u201cplan\\u201d, but what you \\u201cDo\\u201d : Krishna Lord Krishna talks about people centering their lives around one failure or a single disappointment. He says, when some\\n\\nthose Kshatriyas of mighty energy, impelled by the desire of victory,\\n\\nsurrounded that foremost of men. Proclaiming their names and families and\\n\\ntheir diverse feats, they showered their arrows on Partha. Pouring\\n\\nshowers of arrows of such fierce energy as were capable of impeding the\\n\\ncourse of hostile elephants, those heroes surrounded the son of Kunti,\\n\\ndesirous of vanquishing him in battle. Themselves seated on cars, they\\n\\nfought Arjuna of fierce feats who was, on foot. From every side they\\n\\nbegan to strike that hero, that slayer of the Nivatakavachas, that\\n\\ndestroyer of the Samasaptakas, that killer of the king of the Sindhus.\\n\\nSurrounding him on every side as within a cage by means of a thousand\\n\\ncars and ten thousand horses, those brave warriors expressed their\\n\\nexaltation. Recollecting the slaughter by Dhananjaya of Jayadratha in\\n\\nbattle, O thou of Kuru's race, they poured heavy showers of arrows on\\n\\nthat hero like a mass of clouds showering a heavy downpour. Over-whelmed\\n\\nsee Arjuna. His bow, however, is visible to us. Even that is celebrated\\n\\nbow Gandiva of terrible twang. Blessed be thou. Let all dangers fly from\\n\\nthy path. Let fear nowhere inspire thee. When he returns we shall behold\\n\\nhim, for it is certain that he will come back.' The high-souled Arjuna\\n\\nrepeatedly heard these and similar other sweet words of men and women, O\\n\\nchief of the Bharatas. A disciple of Yajnavalkya, who was well-versed in\\n\\nall sacrificial rites and who was a complete master of the Vedas,\\n\\nproceeded with Partha for performing auspicious rites in favour of the\\n\\nhero. Many Brahmanas also, O king, all well-conversant with the Vedas,\\n\\nand many Kshatriyas too, followed the high-souled hero, at the command, O\\n\\nmonarch, of Yudhishthira the just. The horse then roamed, O foremost of\\n\\nmen, wherever he liked over the Earth already conquered by Pandavas with\\n\\nthe energy of their weapons. In course of the horse's wanderings, O king,in battle, It is evident that men do not die till their hour comes.[198]\\n\\nOh, the heart of this princess seems to be very hard since it does not\\n\\nbreak even at the sight of her mighty-armed and broad-chested husband\\n\\nlying dead on the ground. It is evident that one does not die till one's\\n\\nhour comes, since neither myself, nor my mother is deprived of life (at\\n\\neven such a sight). Alas, alas, the golden coat of mail of this foremost\\n\\nhero of Kuru's race, slain by me, his son, knowingly, is lying on the\\n\\nground, cut off from his body. Alas, ye Brahmanas, behold my heroic sire\\n\\nlying prostrate on the Earth, on a hero's bed, slain by his son. What\\n\\nbenefit is done to this hero, slain by me in battle, by those Brahmanas\\n\\nwho were commissioned to attend upon this foremost one of Kuru's race\\n\\nengaged in following the steed? Let the Brahmanas direct what expiation\\n\\nshould now be undergone by me, a cruel and sinful wretch, that has slain\\n\\nwell-skilled in aims, differing from one another in mien and attire, and\\n\\nhailing from diverse realms.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'Thus addressed by his sire, he of eyes like\\n\\nlotus-petals narrated, in the presence of his mother also, how the\\n\\nKaurava heroes had been slain in battle.'\\n\\n\\\"Vasudeva said, 'The feats were highly wonderful that were achieved by\\n\\nthose high-souled Kshatriyas. In consequence of their large number, they\\n\\nare incapable of being enumerated in even hundreds of years. I shall\\n\\nhowever, mention only the foremost of them. Do thou listen, therefore, to\\n\\nme as I mention in brief those feats achieved by the kings of Earth. O\\n\\nthou of godlike splendour. Bhishma of Kuru's race became the\\n\\ngeneralissimo, having eleven divisions of the Kaurava princes under his\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nmagic (instead of any human agency). The Kaurava hero, piercing the\\n\\nhostile host with showers of arrows, looked resplendent like the autumnal\\n\\nSun when he disperses the clouds with his powerful rays.'\\\"\\n\\nSECTION LXXVIII\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'The irresistible wielder of Gandiva, addresst for\\n\\nbattle, stood immovable on the field like Himavat himself. The Saindhava\\n\\nwarriors, once more rallying, showered in great wrath repeated down-pours\\n\\nof shifts on him. The mighty-armed hero, laughing at his foes, who had\\n\\nonce more rallied but who were on the point of death, addressed them in\\n\\nthese soft words,--'Do ye fight to the best of your power and do ye\\n\\nendeavour to vanquish me. Do ye however, accomplish all necessary acts,\\n\\nfor a great danger awaits you all. See, I fight all of you, baffling your\\n\\nclouds of arrows. Bent as you are on battle, tarry a little. I shall soon\\n\\nquell your pride.' The wielder of Gandiva, having said these words in\\n\\nhas been my sin that my I rescue is impossible. This Dhananjaya, the son\\n\\nof Pandu, was the one hero endued with mighty energy. Possessed of\\n\\nrighteous soul, he was the author of my being. How can I be rescued after\\n\\nhaving slain him? Having uttered these lamentations, the high-souled son\\n\\nof Dhananjaya, king Vabhruvahana, touched water and became silent, vowing\\n\\nto starve himself to death.'\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana continued, 'When the king of Manipura, that chastiser of\\n\\nfoes, afflicted with grief, along with his mother, sat down to starve\\n\\nhimself to death, Ulupi then thought of the gem that has the virtue of\\n\\nreviving a dead man. The gem, the great refuge of the snakes, thus\\n\\nthought of, came there. The daughter of the prince of snakes taking it\\n\\nup, uttered these words that highly gladdened the combatants standing on\\n\\nthe field. 'Rise up, O son. Do not grieve. Jishnu has not been vanquished\\n\\nby thee. This hero is incapable of being vanquished by men as also by the\"]}": {

Bhishma's decision to renounce sex and marriage, known as Akhanda Pratigya, was made to ensure his father's happiness and to allow him to marry the woman he loved, Satyavati. This decision was a demonstration of Bhishma's sense of duty and loyalty to his father, as well as his willingness to put his father's happiness above his own personal desires.\\n\\nHowever, as the story progresses, it becomes clear that Bhishma's vow of celibacy has unintended consequences. When his father's wife, Satyavati, requests him to either marry or make the two queens pregnant, Bhishma is unable to fulfill her request due to his vow. This decision ultimately leads to the kingdom being without a king and the birth of Dhritarashtra and Pandu, who are flawed in their own ways.\\n\\nThis storyline highlights the tension between duty and personal desire in the Mahabharata. Bhishma's sense of duty and loyalty to his father leads him to make a decision that ultimately has negative consequences. This serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of considering the long-term effects of one's actions and the need to balance duty with personal desire.\\n\\nFurthermore, Bhishma's story also raises questions about the nature of duty and personal desire. Is it possible to fulfill one's duty without sacrificing one's personal desires? Or are duty and personal desire mutually exclusive? The Mahabharata suggests that the answer to these questions is complex and context-dependent.\\n\\nIn the context of Bhishma's story, his vow of celibacy is portrayed as a noble and selfless act, but one that ultimately leads to negative consequences. This serves as a reminder that even the most well-intentioned actions can have unintended effects, and that duty and personal desire must be carefully balanced in order to achieve a positive outcome.\\n\\nOverall, Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata by highlighting the tension between these two competing values and the need to balance them in order to achieve a positive outcome.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"How does Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"Lessons From Mahabharata Mahabharata is a treasure trove of wisdom and leadership lessons for all walks of life.

        "{\"actual_output\": \"Karna and Arjuna are two of the most prominent characters in the Mahabharata, each with their own distinct personality, strengths, and weaknesses. While they share some similarities, their differences are equally pronounced.\\n\\nOne of the most striking similarities between Karna and Arjuna is their unwavering dedication to their duty and their desire to prove themselves as warriors. Both characters are driven by a sense of honor and a need to demonstrate their prowess in battle. This shared trait is evident in their interactions with each other, as they engage in a series of intense and competitive battles.\\n\\nHowever, their approaches to warfare and their personalities diverge significantly. Karna is depicted as a skilled and ruthless warrior, willing to do whatever it takes to emerge victorious. He is driven by a desire for glory and recognition, and his actions are often motivated by a sense of pride and ambition. In contrast, Arjuna is portrayed as a more introspective and compassionate character, who is more concerned with the well-being of his family and his people than with personal glory.\\n\\nDespite their differences, both characters share a deep sense of loyalty and duty to their families and their kingdom. Karna's actions are motivated by a desire to protect his family and his kingdom, while Arjuna's actions are driven by a sense of responsibility to his family and his people.\\n\\nThe parallel journeys of Karna and Arjuna also contribute to the epic's themes of duty, honor, and the nature of war. Both characters are forced to confront their own limitations and vulnerabilities, and they must learn to navigate the complexities of battle and the moral gray areas that it presents.\\n\\nThrough their interactions, the epic highlights the tension between duty and personal desire, as well as the difficulties of balancing competing loyalties and responsibilities. The epic also explores the nature of war and the human cost of conflict, as Karna and Arjuna are forced to confront the harsh realities of battle and the consequences of their actions.\\n\\nUltimately, the similarities and differences between Karna and Arjuna serve to underscore the complexities and nuances of the epic's themes, and to highlight the multifaceted nature of human experience.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Compare and contrast the characters of Karna and Arjuna, analyzing their similarities, differences, and how their parallel journeys contribute to the epic's themes.\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"And the people,\\r\\ntoo, came away, some naming Arjuna, some Karna, and some Duryodhana (as\\r\\nthe victor of the day).

For this reason, O tiger among men, a dreadful destruction of\\r\\nkinsmen is taking place, caused either by Destiny or by thy evil policy,\\r\\nO king.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\n\\nIndeed, piercing Drona's son with four and sixty shafts, and the\\r\\nruler of the Madras with a hundred, and the Sindhu king with ten\\r\\nbroad-headed arrows, and Vrishasena with three arrows and Saradwata's son\\r\\nwith twenty, Partha uttered a loud shout.  Desirous of baffling the vow of\\r\\nSavyasachin, thy warriors, excited with wrath, quickly rushed at\\r\\nDhananjaya from all sides.  Then Arjuna, frightening the Dhartarashtras,\\r\\ninvoked into existence the Varuna weapon on all sides.  The Kauravas,\\r\\nhowever, on their costly cars, pouring showers of arrows, advanced\\r\\nagainst the son of Pandu.  But, O Bharata, in course of that stupefying\\r\\nand fierce engagement, fraught with the greatest confusion, that price,\\r\\nviz., Arjuna, decked with diadem and gold chain never lost his senses.  On\\r\\nthe other hand, he continued to pour showers of arrows.  Desirous of\\r\\nrecovering the kingdom and recollecting all the wrongs he had suffered\\r\\nfor twelve years in consequence of the Kurus, the high-souled and\\r\\nimmeasurable Arjuna darkened all the points of the compass with shafts\\r\\nfrom Gandiva. \"]}": {

Draupadi, Kunti, and Gandhari are three prominent female characters who embody various aspects of feminine power and agency.\\n\\nDraupadi, the daughter of King Yudhishthira, is a central figure in the epic. Her actions and choices drive the narrative, particularly in the context of the Kauravas' oppression and the Pandavas' struggle. Draupadi's decision to marry the five Kaurava brothers, including Arjuna, is a pivotal moment in the story. This choice reflects the epic's views on dharma, as it allows the Pandavas to reclaim their rightful place and restore balance to the kingdom. Draupadi's actions also highlight the complexities of female agency, as she navigates the patriarchal society and finds ways to assert her power and influence.\\n\\nKunti, the wife of King Dhritarashtra, is a powerful and intelligent woman who plays a crucial role in the epic. Her actions and choices drive the narrative, particularly in the context of the Pandavas' struggle. Kunti's decision to worship the gods and her subsequent actions as a mother and wife reflect the epic's views on dharma and the importance of women's roles in society. Kunti's character also highlights the complexities of female power, as she navigates the constraints of her position as a queen and a mother.\\n\\nGandhari, the wife of King Dhritarashtra, is a wise and compassionate woman who plays a significant role in the epic. Her actions and choices drive the narrative, particularly in the context of the Pandavas' struggle. Gandhari's decision to worship the gods and her subsequent actions as a mother and wife reflect the epic's views on dharma and the importance of women's roles in society. Gandhari's character also highlights the complexities of female power, as she navigates the constraints of her position as a queen and a mother.\\n\\nThe epic's views on gender, power, and dharma are reflected in the characters' actions and choices. The women's roles in the epic are often defined by their relationships with the men, particularly their husbands and sons. However, the women also exhibit agency and power in their own right, as seen in Draupadi's decision to marry the Kaurava brothers and Kunti's decision to worship the gods.\\n\\nThe epic's portrayal of women's roles in society is also complex and multifaceted. The women are often depicted as being bound by the constraints of their position, particularly as queens and mothers. However, the women also exhibit a sense of agency and power, as seen in their actions and choices. The epic's views on gender, power, and dharma are reflective of the societal norms of the time, but also challenge these norms in various ways.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the role of women in the Mahabharata is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma.
