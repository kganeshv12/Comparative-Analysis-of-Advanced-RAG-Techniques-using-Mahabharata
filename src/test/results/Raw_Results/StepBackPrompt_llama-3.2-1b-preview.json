This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength. They took the benefit of everyone in their army by making them efficient in their actions. A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nsmall wealth, the Pandavas obtained numerous agreeable services from\\n\\ntheir feudatories and followers. King Dhritarashtra liberated prisoners\\n\\nand pardoned those that were condemned to death. King Yudhishthira the\\n\\njust never said anything to this. On those occasions when the son of\\n\\nAmvika went on pleasure excursions, the Kuru king Yudhishthira of great\\n\\nenergy used to give him every article of enjoyment. Aralikas, and\\n\\njuice-makers, and makers of Ragakhandavas waited on king Dhritarashtra as\\n\\nbefore.[1] Pandu's son, collected costly robes and garlands of diverse\\n\\nkinds and duly offered them to Dhritarashtra. Maireya wines, fish of\\n\\nvarious kinds, and sherbets and honey, and many delightful kinds of food\\n\\nprepared by modifications (of diverse articles), were caused to be made\\n\\nfor the old king as in his days of prosperity. Those kings of Earth who\\n\\ncame there one after another, all used to wait upon the old Kuru monarch\\n\\n\\\"Vaisampayana said, 'With the permission of the Kuru king, the Pandavas,\\n\\nO monarch, with their troops and the ladies of their household, supported\\n\\nthemselves on diverse kinds of food and drink and passed about a month in\\n\\ngreat happiness in that forest. Towards the close of that period, O\\n\\nsinless one, Vyasa came there. While all those princes sat around Vyasa,\\n\\nengaged in conversation on diverse subjects, other Rishis came to that\\n\\nspot. They were Narada, and Parvata and Devala of austere penances, and\\n\\nViswavasu and Tumvuru, and Chitrasena., O Bharata. Endued with severe\\n\\npenances, the Kuru king Yudhishthira, with the permission of\\n\\nDhritarashtra, worshipped them according to due rites. Having obtained\\n\\nthat worship from Yudhishthira, all of them sat down on sacred seats\\n\\n(made of Kusa grass), as also on excellent seats made of peacock\\n\\nfeathers. After they had all taken their seats, the Kuru king of high\\n\\nintelligence took his seat there, surrounded by the sons of Pandu.\\n\\ncommand, like Vasava of the celestial forces.[176] Sikhandin of great\\n\\nintelligence, protected by the blessed Arjuna, became the leader of the\\n\\nseven divisions of the sons of Pandu. The battle between the Kurus and\\n\\nthe Pandavas (under these leaders) raged for ten days. It was so fierce\\n\\nas to make one's hair stand on its end. Then Sikhandin, in great battle,\\n\\naided by the wielder of Gandiva, slew, with innumerable arrows, the son\\n\\nof Ganga fighting bravely. Lying on a bed of arrows, Bhishma waited like\\n\\nan ascetic till the sun leaving his southward path entered on his\\n\\nnortherly course when that hero gave up his life-breaths. Then Drona,\\n\\nthat foremost of all persons conversant with arms, that greatest of men\\n\\nunder Duryodhana, like Kavya himself of the lord of the Daityas, became\\n\\ngeneralissimo.[177] That foremost of regenerate persons, ever boasting of\\n\\nhis prowess in battle, was supported by the remnant of the Kaurava forceOther Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much successful in their action plans as compared to Kauravas. This helped Pandavas in winning the war. In any company, top management should share the responsibility with middle and lower level management for the effective implementation of their plans and policies. 3.3 Common Goals and Team work Individual goals are difficult to achieve while group efforts of common goals can easily be accomplished. The main leaders of Kauravas i.e Bheeshma, Drona, Karna, Shalya etc. were focused on their personal goals., while Pandavas\\u2019 full efforts were towards the attainment of their common objectives. All of them took part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war.

All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault. Gandhari the wife of Dhritrashtra was committed to his blind husband and she also lived her life as a blind. During the battle of Mahabharata, Pandavas win over Kauravas due to their commitment and dedication. Yudhishthra faced Karna in the battle knowing\\n\\nnew ideas, innovative practices. This will help the team members to take responsibilities and grow higher. In addition organizations will earn more profits and achieve their goals in lesser time. In Mahabharata, Kauravas had centralized leadership there was only one head at a time of eleven divisions. Organizational Structure of Kaurvas On the other hand, Pandavas have opted decentralized system. Lord Krishna was the supreme guide. Arjuna was the supreme commander. Dhrshtadymna was commander in chief of seven commanders. The Pandavas made seven commanders for the seven divisions. The army of Pandavas was decentralized in to seven divisions called as Akshauhini. Besides, Yudhishtra, Bhima, Nakul, Sahadeva, Kunti and Draupadi also participated in management. Organizational Structure of Pandavas Other Decision takers of Pandavas The sharing of responsibilities by Pandavas resulted in democracy, less dependence on one individual and reduction in risk. Therefore, Pandavas were very much\\n\\nfeminine, sustainable traits of Women balance the aggressive and dominating masculine traits which help the organization to achieve higher and sustainable goals. In Mahabharata, Kauravas followed patriarchal structure. They didn\\u2019t involve women in decision making. Moreover they also dishonoured Draupadi. On the other side, Pandavas followed their mother Kunti who was the supreme authority. Yudhishtra obeyed the words of Kunti as Dharma Draupadi also participated in decision making. In fact, the war of Mahabharata was the result of disgrace of Draupadi by Kauravas. Women role in decision making helped Pandavas to win the war. 3.16 Loyalty One can succeed in long run in life only if he is loyal. Companies also demand loyal employees for their success. In Mahabharata, Karan remained loyal to his friend Duruyodhana even after knowing the fact that he is the eldest brother of Pandavas. 3.17 Being Impartial Efficient leaders should be impartial. Each and everyone should be rewarded\"]}": {

I think that what has happened is due to the cords of Time (with which he binds us all). It behoveth thee also to see it.\\n\\nseen, when it was served out for eating, innumerable worms of diverse\\n\\nkinds. When Brahmanas, receiving gifts, blessed the day or the hour\\n\\n(fixed for this or that undertaking) or when high-souled men were engaged\\n\\nin silent recitations, the heavy tread was heard of innumerable men\\n\\nrunning about, but no one could be seen to whom the sound of such tread\\n\\ncould be ascribed. The constellations were repeatedly seen to be struck\\n\\nby the planets. None amongst the Yadavas could, however, obtain a sight\\n\\nof the constellation of his birth. When the Panchajanya was blown in\\n\\ntheir houses, asses of dissonant and awful voice brayed aloud from every\\n\\ndirection. \\\"Beholding these signs that indicated the perverse course of\\n\\nTime, and seeing that the day of the new moon coincided with the\\n\\nthirteenth (and the fourteenth) lunation, Hrishikesa, summoning the\\n\\nYadavas, said unto them these words: The fourteenth lunation has been\\n\\nanyone. Why then, O chief of Bharatas race, this exceedingly dejected\\n\\naspect? It behoveth thee, O son of Pritha, to tell me all, if, indeed,\\n\\nthere be no harm in telling it.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"Arjuna said, He whose complexion was like that of a (newly-risen) cloud,\\n\\nhe whose eyes were like a pair of large lotus petals, Krishna, has, with\\n\\nRama, cast off his body and ascended to Heaven. At Prabhasa, through iron\\n\\nbolts generated by the curse denounced by Brahmanas, the destruction has\\n\\ntaken place of the Vrishni heroes. Awful hath that carnage been, and not\\n\\neven a single hero has escaped. The heroes of the Bhoja, the Andhaka, and\\n\\nthe Vrishni races, O Brahmana, who were all endued with high souls, great\\n\\nmight, and leonine pride, have slaughtered one another in battle.\\n\\nPossessed of arms that looked like maces of iron, and capable of bearing\\n\\nthe strokes of heavy clubs and darts, alas, they have all been slain with\\n\\nblades of Eraka grass. Behold the perverse course of Time. 500,000\\n\\nstupefied, the Saindhava warriors once more shot at that senseless\\n\\nwarrior, without loss of time, innumerable other shafts. Understanding\\n\\nthat the son of Pritha was deprived of consciousness, the deities, with\\n\\nhearts penetrated by fear, began to seek his welfare by uttering diverse\\n\\nbenedictions. Then the celestial Rishis, the seven Rishis, and the\\n\\nregenerate Rishis, became engaged in silent recitations from desire of\\n\\ngiving victory to Pritha's son of great intelligence. When at last the\\n\\nenergy of Partha blazed forth through those acts of the denizens of\\n\\nHeaven, that hero, who was conversant with celestial weapons of high\\n\\nefficacy, stood immovable like a hill. The delighter of the Kurus then\\n\\ndrew his celestial bow. And as he repeatedly stretched the bowstring, the\\n\\ntwang that followed resembled the loud sound of some mighty machine. Like\\n\\nPurandara pouring rain, the puissant Arjuna then, with that bow of his,also, O foremost of men, with Bhima for thy helpmate and the twins, O\\n\\nmighty-armed hero, has the great work of the gods been accomplished. O\\n\\nforemost one of Kurus race, I regard thee and thy brothers as crowned\\n\\nwith success, for ye have accomplished the great purpose of your lives.\\n\\nThe time has come for your departure from the world. Even this, O\\n\\npuissant one, is what is beneficial for you now. Even thus, understanding\\n\\nand prowess and foresight, O Bharata, arise when days of prosperity have\\n\\nnot outrun. These very acquisitions disappear when the hour of adversity\\n\\ncomes. All this has Time for its root. Time is, indeed, the seed of the\\n\\nuniverse, O Dhananjaya. It is Time, again, that withdraws everything at\\n\\nits pleasure. One becomes mighty, and, again, losing that might, becomes\\n\\nweak. One becomes a master and rules others, and, again, losing that\\n\\nposition, becomes a servant for obeying the behests of others. Thy\\n\\nthe four sons of Pandu, that is, Bhima and Arjuna and twins. This\\n\\n(tremendous) carnage, O king, could not happen without the influence of\\n\\ndestiny. Without doubt, by Kshatriyas in particular, should foes be slain\\n\\nand death encountered in battle. By those foremost of men, endued with\\n\\nscience and might of arms, the Earth has been exterminated with her\\n\\nsteeds and cars and elephants. Thy son was not the cause of that carnage\\n\\nof high-souled kings. Thou wert not the cause, nor thy servants, nor\\n\\nKarna, nor Suvala's son. The destruction of those foremost ones of Kuru's\\n\\nrace and of kings by thousands, know, was brought about by destiny. Who\\n\\ncan say anything else in this? Thou art regarded as the Guru and the\\n\\nmaster of the whole world. We, therefore, in thy presence, absolve thy\\n\\nrighteous-souled son. Let that king, with all his associates, obtain the\\n\\nregions reserved for heroes. Permitted by foremost of Brahmanas, let him\\n\\nfor applying each. Calamity, O king, as it overtakes rulers should be\\n\\nregarded as of many forms. Listen, O thou of Kuru's race, as to what\\n\\nthose diverge forms are. Verily of various kinds are calamities, O son of\\n\\nPandu. Thou shouldst always count them, distinguishing their forms, O\\n\\nking, and strive to meet them by applying the well-known ways of\\n\\nconciliation and the rest (without concealing them through idleness). The\\n\\nking should, when equipt with a good force, march (out against a foe), O\\n\\nscorcher of enemies. He should attend also to the considerations of time\\n\\nand place, while preparing to march, as also to the forces he has\\n\\ncollected and his own merits (in other respects). That king who is\\n\\nattentive to his own growth and advancement should not march unless\\n\\nequipt with cheerful and healthy warriors. When strong, O son of Pandu,\\n\\nhe may march in even an unfavourable season. The king should make a river\\n\\nhaving quivers for its stones, steeds and cars for its current, and\\n\\nforts, and the forces, O foremost one of Kuru's race, may or may not be\\n\\ntampered with. (Thou shouldst, therefore, behave in such a manner that\\n\\nthese may not be tampered with by thy foes). The twelve (enumerated\\n\\nabove), O son of Kunti, constitute the principal concerns of kings. These\\n\\ntwelve, as also sixty, having Ministers for their foremost, should be\\n\\nlooked after by the king.[14] Professors conversant with the science of\\n\\npolitics call these by the name of Mandala. Understand, O Yudhishthira,\\n\\nthat the six incidents (of peace, war, march, halt, sowing dissensions,\\n\\nand conciliation) depend upon these. Growth and diminution should also be\\n\\nunderstood, as also the condition of being stationary. The attributes of\\n\\nthe sixfold incidents, O thou of mighty arms, as resting on the two and\\n\\nseventy (already enumerated), should also be carefully understood. When\\n\\none's own side has become strong and the side of the foe his become weak,\"]}": {

This decision was likely motivated by the king's desire to conserve his physical and mental strength, as he had been living in a state of asceticism for some time.\\n\\n2. **The Yajaka Brahmanas' actions**: The Yajaka Brahmanas, who were present in the woods, cast off the king's sacrificial fires in a solitary part of the woods, allowing the fires to grow and eventually produce a general conflagration in the forest.\\n\\n3. **The consequences of the conflagration**: The conflagration in the forest had immediate and long-term consequences. The king, who had been unable to move or exert himself due to his emaciated state, was unable to escape the forest. His two mothers, who were also emaciated, were unable to move either. The king's inability to move or exert himself led to his death, as he was unable to defend himself against the flames.\\n\\n4. **The long-term consequences**: The burning of the Khandava Forest had long-term consequences for the kingdom. The forest was said to be burnt by the deity of fire, which was a powerful and feared entity. The forest was also said to have produced a general conflagration in the forest, which was a sign of the deity's power and displeasure. The burning of the forest also led to the death of the king, which was a significant blow to the kingdom.\\n\\n5. **The emotional and psychological impact**: The burning of the Khandava Forest also had an emotional and psychological impact on the kingdom. The sound of lamentations uttered by the heroes who had been burnt to death filled the spacious chambers of the palace, and the palace was said to have been enveloped in gloom. The king's death was also said to have caused distress to the Nagas, who were said to be headed by Vasuki.\\n\\n6. **The consequences for the Pandavas**: The burning of the Khandava Forest also had consequences for the Pandavas, who were said to have beheld the deity of fire standing before them. The deity of fire was said to have addressed the Pandavas, saying that they were the god of fire, and that the forest of Khandava had been burnt by him. The Pandavas were also said to have been affected by the deity's words, and were said to have become stupefied.\\n\\n7. **The consequences for the kingdom**: The burning of the Khandava Forest also had consequences for the kingdom.

He renounces sex for his father's happiness, which is a selfless act that prioritizes the well-being of others over his own desires. This reflects the theme of duty versus personal desire, where individuals prioritize the greater good over their own personal interests.\\n\\n2. **Selflessness and Sacrifice**: Bhishma's decision to renounce sex is a selfless act that demonstrates his commitment to his father's happiness. He is willing to sacrifice his own desires and well-being for the sake of his family and the kingdom. This selflessness is a hallmark of duty, where individuals prioritize the greater good over their own interests.\\n\\n3. **Personal Desire vs. Duty**: Bhishma's devotion to his father's happiness is also a manifestation of his personal desire. He is deeply devoted to his father and wants to ensure his happiness, even if it means sacrificing his own desires. This personal desire is a fundamental aspect of human nature, where individuals prioritize their own interests over the greater good.\\n\\n4. **Contextual Consideration**: Bhishma's decision is influenced by the context of his situation. He is deeply devoted to his father and wants to ensure his happiness, which is a personal desire. However, his vow of celibacy is also influenced by the context of his situation, where he is expected to marry and produce children to secure the future of the kingdom. This highlights the importance of considering the context in which individuals make decisions, as it can influence their motivations and priorities.\\n\\n5. **Consequences of Personal Desire**: Bhishma's decision ultimately leads to negative consequences, as his vow of celibacy is not fulfilled, and he is unable to marry and produce children. This highlights the importance of considering the potential consequences of personal desires, as they can lead to negative outcomes.\\n\\n6. **Influence of External Factors**: Bhishma's decision is also influenced by external factors, such as the influence of his stepmother, Satyavati, and the pressure from his father to marry and produce children. This highlights the importance of considering the influence of external factors on individual decisions, as they can shape the course of events.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Bhishma's vow of celibacy and his devotion to his father's happiness reflect the theme of duty versus personal desire in the Mahabharata. His selfless act demonstrates his commitment to his father's happiness, while his personal desire is a fundamental aspect of human nature.

Satyavati then requests Vyasa to make Ambalika and Ambika pregnant but the results were not satisfactory. Dhritarashtra was blind and Pandu was a weakling. So one side, you see integrity and commitment. On the flip side, you see the decision that produced a positive result on one context brought a negative consequence in the other. This is what happens in life when you take decisions with shortsightedness. A decision which is fit in one context turns out to be complete opposite going forward and you are thrown into wilderness.

By choosing to be Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna was fulfilling his role as a divine mentor and guide, which was essential for Arjuna's spiritual growth and development.\\n\\n2. **Crisis Management**: Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer was also a strategic move to manage the crisis situation. By being Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna was able to provide emotional support, guidance, and strategic advice to Arjuna, which helped him to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of the war.\\n\\n3. **Personal Sacrifice**: Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer was also a personal sacrifice. By choosing to be Arjuna's charioteer, Krishna was putting himself in harm's way, as he was exposed to the dangers of the battlefield. This selfless act of sacrifice was a testament to Krishna's devotion to Arjuna and his commitment to helping him achieve his goals.\\n\\n4. **Role Modeling**: Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer also served as a role model for Arjuna. By being a loyal and dedicated charioteer, Krishna set an example for Arjuna to follow, demonstrating the importance of selflessness, loyalty, and devotion in the face of adversity.\\n\\n5. **Avoiding Conflict**: Finally, Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer may have also been a strategic move to avoid conflict. By not fighting in the war himself, Krishna was able to avoid the risks and dangers associated with combat, which would have put him and others at risk. This decision allowed Krishna to focus on his spiritual duties and provide guidance to Arjuna, rather than being drawn into the conflict.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Krishna's decision to be Arjuna's charioteer was a complex and multifaceted one, driven by a combination of spiritual, strategic, personal, role modeling, and avoidance motivations.\", \"context\": null, \"expected_output\": null, \"hyperparameters\": null, \"input\": \"Why did Krishna choose to be Arjuna's charioteer rather than fight in the war himself?\", \"retrieval_context\": [\"should motivate and inspire team members for attaining effective functioning.

Her actions drive the narrative, showcasing her strength, courage, and determination. As a blind wife, Gandhari is a symbol of feminine strength and resilience, choosing to live her life despite her disability.

Their actions drive the narrative, showcasing their strength, courage, and determination, and reflect the epic's views on gender, power, and dharma.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Mahabharata is a powerful epic that reflects the values of Hinduism, including the importance of feminine power, the balance of masculine and feminine traits, and the role of women in society.

Though Pandavas do not have wealth, power and kingdom at that time but they won the battle due to guidance of Lord Krishna, morals, ethics, effective management policies, powerful allies like love, compassion, sweetness, relations, decentralization of power, team work, women empowerment etc. The epic exhibits our human value system. The teachings of Mahabharata provide us the knowledge of management from its various incidents. Lord Krishna, the main hero is known as the master strategist, a visionary leader, a great crisis manager and a good path maker. Mahabharata is a good source of effective understanding of the various management traits to be used in modern management like planning the strategies, leadership qualities, motivation, decision-making etc. Lord Krishna is considered as the best Management Guru. Preaching of \\u2018Bhagvad Gita\\u2019 to Arjuna directly by Krishna in the battle field bring forth many management principles. Modern managers are really blessed to equip\\n\\nrace, and Draupadi of great fame, having observed the preliminary fast, set out with their faces towards the east. Setting themselves on Yoga, those high-souled ones, resolved to observe the religion of Renunciation, traversed through various countries and reached diverse rivers and seas. Yudhishthira, proceeded first. Behind him was Bhima; next walked Arjuna; after him were the twins in the order of their birth; behind them all, O foremost one of Bharatas race, proceeded Draupadi, that first of women, possessed of great beauty, of dark complexion, and endued with eyes resembling lotus petals.

Costly beds and robes and ornaments, and food and drink\\n\\nand other enjoyable articles, in profusion and of such superior kinds as\\n\\nwere worthy of royal use, were presented by king Yudhishthira unto\\n\\nDhritarashtra. Similarly Kunti behaved towards Gandhari as towards a\\n\\ntook part in decision-making and contributed a lot in the planning of the battle. This unity and team-spirit made them successful in the war. Kauravas were equipped with more weapons and physical force. No doubt, Pandavas were less in number but their unity was their strength.

A corporate house should get contributions from each and everybody being their part for enhancing their skills. 3.4 Commitment and dedication Pandavas were very much committed about their goals. All the brothers showed good sincerity and dedication for each other. Karan was also very much committed to his friend in spite of the fact that his friend Duryodhan was at fault.
